  "description": "iroh is a library to establish direct connections between two peers. The workshop will start with an overview of how iroh works and what it provides. After this we'll explore establishing connections between two endpoints before progressing to using a gossip protocol to send messages to multiple peers. At the end we should have a simplistic group chat application.\n",
