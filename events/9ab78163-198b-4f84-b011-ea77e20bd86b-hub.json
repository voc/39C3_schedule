  "abstract": "With its 10 oscillators, the Levitation OSC produces spherical sounds and beats down to the very deepest sub-bass range. Sine and sawtooth are available as waveforms in a wide frequency range. In addition to additive synthesis, there are optional noisio-typical 8-bit register overflows for sound calculation and a one button random chime generator.",
  "description": "**noisio Levitation OSC Drone Synthesizer**\n\n**Materials costs**:  \n\u20ac20 - \u20ac50\n\n**Taught by** noisio.\n\n**Workshop Itinerary**: Solder yourself a synth from easy to peasy. This workshop will focus on the Levitation OSC, but other noisio synths can be build in parallel.\nNo previous solder experiences are necessary.\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit in the hours before the workshop at the Hardware Hacking Area to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: https://noisio.de/boards/levitation-oscillator\n",
