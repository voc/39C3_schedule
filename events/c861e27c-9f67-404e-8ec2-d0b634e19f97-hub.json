  "description": "A rope jam is an open, unstructured space to practice, explore, and share rope skills together.\n\nYou can arrive alone, with a partner, or in a small group. You are welcome to tie, be tied, switch roles, self-tie, observe, or simply quietly talk rope.\n\nWe will start with a short introduction and matching game to help connect people who arrive on time. Late arrivals will not be admitted. You may also bring your own partner or choose to observe only.\n\nThis is a non-sexual space. Sensual, rope-focused play is permitted. Wear what you want. A minimum level of coverage is required at all times, as would be expected in a gym. The event is open to participants aged 18 and over.\n\nWhat to bring\n* Non-stretch rope if you have it\n* A blanket or cushions for sitting on the floor\n* Comfortable clothing. Avoid loose layers if possible\n* A small amount of practice rope will be available.\n\nRules\n* Consent is mandatory. Always ask first.\n* Respect boundaries, focus, and personal space.\n* Do not interrupt active scenes.\n* Keep conversation low and rope-focused.\n* No photography unless everyone involved agrees.\n\nWhether you are new to rope or have years of experience, this is a relaxed space to learn, practice, and connect. Come say hi, we do not bite unless asked.\n\nLocation and time may still change.\nPlaces are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person.\nGet your free ticket here: [https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/ropelabs-ropejam/](https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/ropelabs-ropejam/)\n",
