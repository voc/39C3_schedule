  "description": "Anonymity is more important than ever, and it's not an easy job. Our job is to make it easier! The I2P project is excited to demonstrate 2 new projects, the `go-i2p` and `emissary` embedded router projects. We'll look at how they work and why they're an easier, more accessible way of providing anonymity to your users than freestanding external services. Primary target audience is Go, Rust, and C developers, I2P library developers, and people working on anonymous P2P applications.\n",
