In this class, you will use the Wi-Fi Nugget to learn how hackers attack wireless networks - and how to stop them. We will cover evil QR codes, extracting information like work and travel history from personal devices, Wi-Fi phishing attacks, and how to detect hacking tools like Wi-Fi pineapples. Most importantly, you will learn how to use the Nugget to physically \"foxhunt\" for suspicious Wi-Fi devices and secure your own home network against these common threats.\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or on the website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: [Reserve Your Seat](https://retia.io/products/39c3-workshop-cat-got-your-password-wi-fi-self-defense-for-beginners-30-dec-12-00-14-00)\n\n**Workshop Includes**: Wi-Fi Nugget, Class Coupon, USB Cable\n",
