  "abstract": "The ATtiny Punk Console (short ATPC) is an experimental synthesizer kit designed around the ATtiny85 microprocessor. Once started as an 8-bit equivalent of the famous DIY entry-level Atari Punk Console, it has developed into a minimalistic but feature-rich synth box over the years.\r\nThe latest version now offers a choice of 10 different synth algorithms at startup.",
