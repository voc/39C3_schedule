  "description": "The voting app is a simple blockchain voting app, based on ZK proof generated from a french ID card. The presentation will deep dive in the tech part, first but also present the social movement that wants to bring the referendum culture in France through a voting system that is independent from the State infrastructure, but still can prove that voters are french with the ID digital signature.\nThe voting app is Work in Progress and needs a lot of work. This is also an open call for hackers to help improve and make the app the easiest app for people.\n\nhttps://github.com/ReferendumCitoyen/referendum-citoyen-react-native\n",
