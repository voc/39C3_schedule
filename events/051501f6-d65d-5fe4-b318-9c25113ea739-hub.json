  "description": "But did you know that this family of Languages - it not only includes XSLT but also XPath and XQuery - is still very important in the digital humanities and other niches near you? Would you be surprised to learn that there is an effort to specify the next version 4?\n\nLast year, I joined the QT4 Community Group that is working on that.\n\nCome by if you are interested in hearing where we are headed or just to indulge in the drama about OppenSource maintenance, W3C politics, and why XML is still around even though JSON and YAML are so much simpler!\n",
