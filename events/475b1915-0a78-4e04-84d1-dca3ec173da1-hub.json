  "description": "Since a couple of years, I've been using a custom cursor theme \u2013 the cursor is a turtle emoji! Sometimes I forget that it exists, and people are amused that there's a turtle on my screen! :D\n\nIn this workshop, I'll explain how cursor themes work on Linux, and teach you how to generate your own one! It could be anything you want \u2013 some ideas:\n\n- Draw your own arrows (cool-looking? Weird ones?)\n- Repurpose your favorite icons/logos (so that everyone immediately knows that you're using Arch btw)\n- Bl\u00e5hajs?!\n- High-contrast cursors that are actually more accessible to you\n\nBring a Linux laptop! And it'd be ideal if you could already install the vector graphics program Inkscape and the command line tool `xcursorgen`! I'll show you a little script that will help you generate the theme.\n\nThe resulting themes work both on X.Org as well as Wayland.\n",
