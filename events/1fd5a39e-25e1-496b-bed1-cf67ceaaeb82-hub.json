  "description": "Facial recognition systems are rapidly advancing - fusing infrared, facial geometry, gait, and metadata into oppressive infrastructures of racist policing and surveillance capitalism. At the same time, artists, activists and everyday citizens are developing creative ways to interfere, confuse, and disappear from automated identification.\n\n#### Workshop 1: Break Your Face\nHands-on demonstration of Dazzle anti-surveillance makeup techniques. Live-testing our work to understand machine vision -and how to break it.\n\n#### Workshop 2 + 3: Zine-making\nStarting with a discussion of creative anti-surveillance tactics, we then combine the workshop participants' knowledge and experience to co-creating a zine.\n\nInfo:\u00a0We will be using easily available live face filters on\u00a0smart phones\u00a0(instagram/snapchat/tiktok). Participants can use their own phones. The data is not uploaded or saved anywhere.\n\n\nLinks:\n[www.michelletylicki.info/](www.michelletylicki.info/)\n[www.sanma.cargo.site/](www.sanma.cargo.site/)\n",
