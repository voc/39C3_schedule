No \"cup\". Just cozy get-together.\\\nLet's celebrate the survival of the partial legalization.\n\nMaybe we can realize a seed exchange. Bring along what you have left.\n\nsybb - show your best bud\\\nbyow - bring your own weed\n\nmatrix: [#chaos-cannabis-cup](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/chaos-cannabis-cup):tchncs.de\n",
