In this beginner-friendly hands-on workshop, you\u2019ll build your own EMF Explorer Badge from a kit, learn about different electromagnetic frequency bands, and walk away ready to explore the unseen frequencies that surround our daily lives.",
  "description": "### EMF Explorer Badge Soldering Workshop\n\nIn this hands-on build-and-explore workshop, participants assemble their own **[EMF Explorer Badge](https://emfexplorer.space)** using guided soldering instruction, learn the science of electromagnetic frequency bands, and plug in headphones to *listen* to the invisible world around them. Every participant takes home their own exploration kit: badge + headphones, ready for EMF exploring with an illuminated badge that can be used at night for visibility and bling.\n\n---\n\n##### Material Costs\n\u20ac20 - \u20ac30\n\n---\n\n##### Workshop Itinerary\n- **Welcome + Electronics and Soldering Info** We will show you how to solder. Anyone who can safely hold a soldering iron can do it! It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful.\n- **EMF Explanation and Badge Creation Overview** Learn about what EMF is, where it comes from, and how the badge works.\n- **Badge Assembly** Get to soldering! We will be available to help you along the way.\n- **Check your work, and power up your badge!**\n- **Wrap-Up + Q&A**\n- **Live Exploration!** You are surrounded by interesting electronics at 39C3. Go exploring! What new sounds do you hear? Some of the most unassuming electronics can make the most interesting sounds.\n\n---\n\n##### Registration Info\nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First-come, first-served.\n- **Age:** anyone who can safely hold a soldering iron\n- **Experience level:** No prior soldering experience required\n- **Take-home:** Your assembled badge + headphones included\n\n---\n\n##### Links\n[EmfExplorer.Space](https://emfexplorer.space)\n\n---\n\n##### Instructor Notes\nThis is a **beginner-first hardware workshop**. The goal is skill building, curiosity, and real-world electronics exploration. The badge is both a tool and a conversation piece: it senses EMF, plays it through audio, and glows for visibility and bling.\n\n---\n\n##### Taught by **[Drc3p0](https://links.darcyneal.com)**\n",
