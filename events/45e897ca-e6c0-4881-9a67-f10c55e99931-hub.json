  "description": "**AI-tiny Blinkeshit3000 (SMD reflow for beginners)**\n\n**Materials costs**:  \u20ac25 - \u20ac40\n\n**Taught by**: Swiss Mechatronic Art Society.\n\n**Device**: The Blinken3000 device is based on an ATTiny85 and 4x5 RGB LEDs and - thanks to a custom ATmel booloader - can be programmed via an 3.5mm audio jack.\n\n**Workshop Itinerary**:  Using a self-etched PCB and lots of LEDs, you get the chance to play pick & place machine, before putting your device into the reflow oven to take care of the soldering magic.\n\nAfterwards, it's all about using AI to create fancy colour patterns and experimenting with different kinds of diffusors for sparkling light effects.\n\nNo soldering skills required. Some fine motoric skills needed for placing the components onto the PCB.\n\nNo programming skills required, as we let AI do the heavy software lifting.\n\n**Registration**:  Buy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**:\n",
