  "description": "Inspired by Canadian disabled artist Margeaux Feldman, this project is a practice of resisting ableism and other dehumanizing systemic oppressions. Debra Guckenheimer has taken discarded books and created collages to feature as a backdrop to an affirmation. The affirmation is a rejection of an ableist message she received with a disability justice message on the back. She has distributed over 100 postcards around the world to friends and strangers, who keep the postcard up to recite the affirmation as needed. Audience and artist together create change as they practice letting go of harm. This is Debra's first exhibit in Germany, the home of her grandparents until they fled in 1933, as Debra practices healing some of the trauma her ancestors experienced. This workshop is dedicated to the late disability justice Alice Wong and the ancestors of Debra who were murdered by Nazis. Attendees will receive a disability justice postcard (limited quantity available) to practice healing and resistance.\n",
