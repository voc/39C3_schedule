  "description": "We print with building block tiles, also known as Lego Dots\u2122, on paper.\nThere will be a short introduction to the printing technique and how to create the printing plates.\nWe print using the primary colors and can mix any other color as needed.\n\nWhat makes Lego Dots\u2122 exciting is that you are bound to a grid \u2013 in this case, 8\u00d78 units. The tiles come in different shapes: circles, squares, quarter circles, and many more. Have a look at the\u00a0gallery to see some examples.\n\nWe print using a press from the\u00a0Open Press Project.\nThe print size is limited to 7\u00d77 cm due to the press we are using.\nIt is a \u201cjump-in\u201d workshop with no registration required \u2013 when one person leaves, the next can join in.\n\n\nLink: [https://pxlprnt.de](https://pxlprnt.de)\n",
