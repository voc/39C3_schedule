A certain (web application) development background is beneficial.\n\nFirst, we will be playing a virtual escape the room game with challenges on a web application to get into an attacker's mindset.\nThen follows a quick introduction to the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (2025 Release Candidate).\nFinally use the gathered knowledge to attack a vulnerable web application (https://github.com/Phylu/vulnerable-click-game) and see how these attacks can easily be prevented.\n\nPlease bring your (fully charged) laptop to be able to participate.\n",
