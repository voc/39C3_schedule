  "description": "Starting from the assumption that, as those privileged with knowledge and experience in technology, we are obliged to share it with people who don\u2019t have such competencies. Strengthening non-tech communities is essential for our collective well-being. What is the minimum level of tech education that everyone engaged in class struggle should acquire? Do we have the tools to protect non-tech people in our environment beyond the hackerspaces communities? How to build horizontal safe-spaces, secure infrastructures to educate others and which tools and techniques are the most effective for education?\n\nLet's have a discussion and create ready to use solutions.\n\n\nLink: [https://sanma.cargo.site/](https://sanma.cargo.site/)\n",
