The songs have been used in sing-along events and climate protests, but during the three years the project has existed, the political climate in Sweden has changed. Peaceful singing has been met with hateful rhetoric from the government and repression from the police. It became clear that anti-fascist activism has to be an integrated part of the Climatepoetry.org project, and not a separate activity.",
