  "description": "Born in Berlin 1996, MASCHA is a DJ and music producer, shaped by the city\u2019s dancefloors and her deep roots in one of Berlin\u2019s most renowned House & Techno clubs. Coming from a multi-generational musician family and a background in dance, she approaches DJing as movement and storytelling, her sets unfold with precision, tension, and emotional depth, delivering a 2-hour journey into hypnotic, tribal, and distinctly 90s-rooted soundscapes. Following her live set debut with an orchestra this year, MASCHA continues to push boundaries while staying grounded in the raw essence of club culture.\n",
