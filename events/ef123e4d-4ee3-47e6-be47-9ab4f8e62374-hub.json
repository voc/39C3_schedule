Or do you not know this epic and complex sci-fi board game about diplomacy, politics, war and intrigue yet? Let us use this short time slot for a quick meeting to share our contacts to stay in touch. Possible advantages we are going to have are e.g.:\n\n- New regional groups for (regular) games\n- Sharing/Discussions about house rules\n- Creation/Discussions of new maps\n",
