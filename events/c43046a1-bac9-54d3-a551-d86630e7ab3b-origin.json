  "abstract": "I wanted to design beautiful header diagrams and ASCII tables suitable for stitching on throw pillows, but found existing tools for cross-stitch design to be all wrong. I made my own set of command-line tools for building this chunky, pixelated visual art. If you've never seen a cross-stitch sampler that had bitrot, this talk will fix it.",
  "description": "Designing cross-stitch patterns, I got frustrated with all the programs which expected me to click around a canvas setting individual pixels. I wanted a cross-stitch design software suite that I could drive with a Makefile, which could give me an interactive interface for stitching or compile them to PDF. In short, I wanted to say `echo \"shutdown -h now\" | embellish --border | export pattern --pdf` and get a design worthy of stitching on a pillow.\r\n\r\nSo, I made the thing I wanted. I'll discuss the many yak shaves along the way (proprietary file format reverse-engineering, OAuth2, what 'color' even means, unikernel hosting, and more). I'll talk a bit about the joy of making something so you can make something, and how it feels to craft software that is unapologetically personal.",
