  "description": "This is an advanced soldering workshop for creating motorcontrollers\u00a0that\u00a0bring motors to tap rhythmically with each other. Each participant builds her own board to drive two motors that will then tap in polyrhythms.\u00a0The electronic circuits in this workshop derive from minimal and low-cost bio-inspired robots. Oscillators are used to drive motors that produce sound, but they can also be connected to synthesizers. Each circuit board is designed to be wired up with the boards from the other participants in order to explore together the magic of emergent polyrhythm by wiring their individual circuits to form a huge network.\nBig fun and deep dive into analog circuits and their emergent properties.\n\n\nLink: [https://christian.faubel.derstrudel.org](https://christian.faubel.derstrudel.org)\nMastodon: [https://post.lurk.org/@derstrudel](https://post.lurk.org/@derstrudel)\n",
