  "description": "Hi,\n\nmy name is Yuki and I am part of the DarkFi community. Out of this user/community perspective I will tell you something about the philosophy of DarkFi, the anonymous tech-stack, Lunarpunk, the Desert vs Forest, RegFi vs DarkFi and the DarkFi Vision.\n\nThe talk will not go to deep in the low level tech, because I am also just learning about them :)\n\nI plan to keep the talk short and have a Q&A personally after the talk, in a more 'relaxed' environment.\n\nnote: As you might expect, the talk will be held in english. But I can also speak german, if needed f.e\n\nP.S: This is the first talk I will hold, I am very excited :)\n",
