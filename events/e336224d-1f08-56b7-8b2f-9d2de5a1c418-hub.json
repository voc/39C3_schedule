Public Code!\u201d, which promotes publicly funded software being released as Free Software. Explore how we fight for Device Neutrality and how we want to spark children's interest in coding.\r\n\r\nThe session will also highlight FSFE\u2019s legal support efforts, community-building activities, and public awareness campaigns that help ensure technology remains accessible, transparent, and shaped by its users rather than by restrictive corporate or governmental control.",
