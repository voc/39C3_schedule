  "description": "If the talk introducing celestial navigation inspired you to try taking sights with a sextant and plotting the lines of position on nautical charts, then come to the House of Tea to give it a go.  Bring a pencil, compass and ruler if you have one (we'll have a few to share), but leave your electronic calculator, computer and GPS in the bag since we'll be doing it the traditional way with sliderules, lookup tables and geometry.\n",
