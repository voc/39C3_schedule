  "description": "_Introduction to Embedded Rust on Microcontrollers and the [Hakkaa workshop task](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/project/detail/assembly/hakkaa-board-smd-soldering-embedded-rust-for-begin/). This introduction is mostly aimed at beginner participants._\n\nWe'd like to give you an introduction to Rust on a microcontroller based on [Rust programming language: An absolute beginner workshop with intro presentation](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/rust-programming-language-an-absolute-beginner-wor). It aims to show you the little differences of this environment, presenting the workshop challenge and pointing you in the right direction for getting started.\n\nThis session starts with a presentation of about 30 minutes in English and a round of questions for all. After that, our team supports you with your first self-paced steps.\n\nThe initial part of the presentation covers using Rust on a microcontroller in general. The second part focuses on working with the Hakkaa board.\n\nIf you've got a question after this session, you can find us at the Hakkaatachi assembly or in [our Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#hakkaatachi-39c3:matrix.org).\n\nWe recommend:\n\n* Having a soldered and tested [Hakkaa-Board](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-hardware) (whose kit you can get at the Hakkaatachi assembly)\n* Your laptop set up with the [development tooling](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-firmware?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) so that you can spend more time on programming than on installing\n* Your laptop fully charged\n",
