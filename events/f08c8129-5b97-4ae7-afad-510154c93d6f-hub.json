  "description": "Veggie music with Makey Makey\n\nWeird is wonderful! Crooked cucumbers, bent carrots, and limp potatoes are not only delicious, but also fun music controllers for earthy sounds. How does it work? You connect the vegetables to your computer, record weird and wonderful sounds using the vegetable keys, and use them to create your own beats. One of the most popular workshop at this year's Code Week Hamburg\u2014come by and join us in making weird sounds from Krautrock to cable salad.\n",
