As a DJ, live act, and producer, he seamlessly moves across a broad spectrum of electronic styles \u2014 from ambient and downbeat to deep, driving techno.\nWhether performing solo or engaging in live modular techno jams with artists such as Daniel Miller (Mute Records) or Tino Machauer (Shockwerk, Klar Audio), Jan Dalv\u00edk continues to push the boundaries of electronic expression \u2014 always analog, always authentic.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/jandalvik/techno-set-dalvik-dez-24\nhttps://jandalvik.com/\n",
