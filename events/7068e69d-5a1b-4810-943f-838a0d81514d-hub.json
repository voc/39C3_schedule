  "description": "KinkyGeeks and RopeLabs join forces to host a follow up Beginner Bondage Workshop.\n\nInstructors [@DoodleMe](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/DoodleMe) and [@KnottyLola](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/KnottyLola) explore next steps in Japanese rope bondage. 18+ lab-mode workshop. Bring rope and a blanket if you have them. Attendance at the beginner class helps but is not required.\n\nThis workshop expands on theory and knots from the beginner class and moves at a faster pace. We will briefly recap key skills such as single and double column ties, then progress from there.\n\nThis session suits those with some rope experience or those who attended the introductory workshop. You do not need to have taken Part I, but you should be comfortable with basic rope handling.\n\nThe workshop runs in lab mode. It is fully clothed, non-sexual, and open to participants aged 18 and over only.\n\nSingles, pairs, and groups are welcome. Space is limited by the room size.\n\nPlease bring your own non-stretch rope if you have it, plus a blanket or cushion for sitting on the floor. Avoid loose clothing where possible. The workshop will be taught in English.\n\nPlaces are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person.\nGet your free ticket here: [https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/102-1/](https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/102-1/)\n",
