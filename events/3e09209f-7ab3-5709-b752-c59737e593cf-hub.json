[Open Parliament TV](https://de.openparliament.tv/) lets you search and interact with over 79,000 speeches from the German Bundestag. [Open Data Ranking](https://opendataranking.de/) shows how parliamentary data is (un)available in Germany. We'll talk about the fun of linked open data (oh hai [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Identifiers)), currently challenging conditions and how to make more people aware of it inside and outside of parliaments. We welcome everyone interested in open parliamentary data or working in/around parliaments!",
