The handcuffs are two-colored with black as the base color. \nBiothane is a leather-like, vegan material made of PVC-coated webbing that is both waterproof and very sturdy. \nAdvance registration is required, so please stop by the KinkyGeeks-Assembly beforehand to pick up a ticket. [ALREADY SOLD OUT!]\nThere is a material fee of \u20ac20 for the workshop. Please bring the exact amount if possible.\n",
