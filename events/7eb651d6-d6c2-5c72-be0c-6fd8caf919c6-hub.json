  "abstract": "[NextGraph](https://nextgraph.org/) is a framework aimed at making live collaboration, offline support, end to end encryption, and application interoperability easy.\r\n\r\nIn this demo, I will walk you through the basics of NextGraph and our new TypeScript SDK.\r\n\r\nThe new TypeScript SDK turns RDF graph database records into ordinary, typed objects with instant two\u2011way binding. By proxying those objects and emitting signals, the SDK provides a framework\u2011agnostic reactive layer that integrates cleanly with React, Vue, and Svelte.\r\n\r\n**You will** get a short introduction to NextGraph, RDF (a graph data format designed for interoperability), and a live demo walking through a simple property change, showing how a mutation is instantly persisted to the database, syncronized, and reflected in UI components across React, Vue, and Svelte.",
