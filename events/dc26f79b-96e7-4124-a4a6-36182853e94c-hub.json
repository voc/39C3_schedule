  "description": "Abstract: The world caf\u00e9 creates a space for exchanging stories and insights about ethical non-monogamy (ENM) through rotating small-group conversations. Departing from the experiences of everyone in the room, we'll explore the realities of ENM life, learn from each other's stories and questions and decode relationship patterns. The caf\u00e9 is primarily for those practicing ENM, regardless: those who are curious/exploring are equally welcome.\n",
