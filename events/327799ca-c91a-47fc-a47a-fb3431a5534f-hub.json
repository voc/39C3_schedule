But even back then, there was resistance \u2013 and it was anything but boring!\nRevel in the old days with us and be inspired by past actions and successes!\n\nWe show pictures of the initiative against the chip card system in Berlin, which was active there mainly in the noughties against the precursors of today's payment cards.\n",
