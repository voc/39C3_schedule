  "description": "How do you manage security in small software engineering teams or startups (2-50 people)?\nWhat did you implement? Which changes did you implement or push for as a security person?\n\nI previously worked at a small NGO and startup and want to create a space to share experiences.\n\nInitially, I'll give some insights about what I implemented in the past year, however the goal is to have a discussion.\n\nTopics might include:\n- Fuzzing\n- Responsible disclosure (both incoming and outgoing)\n- DefectDojo, Dependabot and SecObserve\n- GitHub's security features\n- Static analyzers ranging from Semgrep to Zizmor\n\nPut in notes here if you want to join! https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/3iZ8MLCkX9I3xcTsh6uc2LwA/\n",
