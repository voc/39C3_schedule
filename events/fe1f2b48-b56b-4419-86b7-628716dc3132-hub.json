  "description": "Delay Tolerant networks are special kinds of network that allow messages to be transmitted with a (very) long delay. This is achieved by storing data along routing path, on each node. Archipel is an experimental implementation of Bundle Protocol focused on creating a more human network and reducing ecological footprint of network infrastructures.\n\nThis meetup is a conversation to present and talk about Delay Tolerant Networks and Archipel. We'll take some tea and talk about how a slower internet can help empower people and maybe fight capitalism a bit more.\n\nLearn more about Archipel on https://archipelproject.net/\n",
