  "description": "Tinabel (Tina Belmont) is the creator of  \"Rhythm Core Alpha 2\", a music creation system for the Nintendo DSi and 3DS game consoles which was available in the Nintendo eShop until March 2023.\nShe will play a blistering set of her own original music and 1980's covers. \nYes, there are vocals.\nThese songs are fast songs about dark subjects: burnout, secret shame, alienation, failed friendships, abandonment issues, etc.\nYou'll dance and then say \"Wait... what?!\"\nWhile this is electronic, this is a punk show. Expect intensity.\n\nSee http://www.tinabelmont.com and http://www.whitecollarpunk.com to hear the music, or http://rhythmcorealpha.com to learn about the software!\n",
