  "description": "The workshop will be held in German or English depending on the participants.\n\n## Description\nThis workshop offers a personal look into four years of using Minecraft Education in media literacy classes at primary and secondary schools. Many people only know Minecraft as a game \u2013 I aim to show how it can become a practical learning tool that supports creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and digital skills.\n\nThe workshop is intended for anyone interested in how Minecraft can be used meaningfully in education or how teaching works inside an open sandbox environment.\n\n## Topics\n- Why I use Minecraft as an educational tool\n- Concrete experiences from real classrooms\n- Setup and technical requirements\n- Funding options available to schools\n- What Minecraft Education is and how it differs from other versions\n- Open Q&A and peer exchange\n\n## Note on proprietary software\nMinecraft Education is proprietary and owned by Microsoft. This is a valid point of debate within the Chaos community. I will explain why I chose it for school settings, what alternatives I have considered, and where open solutions currently reach their limits. The goal is a transparent, experience-based discussion rather than product promotion.\n\n**Format:** Short input and open discussion\n",
