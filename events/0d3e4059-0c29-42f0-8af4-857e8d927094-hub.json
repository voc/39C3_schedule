  "description": "For two years now, children in the public education system of the russian federation are subjected to an unthinkable scale of militaristic indoctrination. Every child takes part in around 70 war-related holidays per year. The more talented ones are involved into propaganda activities to such degree that they have practically no time to study.\n\nIn this SoS we won't like just to point out that millions of children are being militarized at an unthinkable scale. We also would like to speculate a bit on how and why it is possible that many of you still probably do not know about it.\n\n---\n\nTo draw attention to the above-mentioned topic, there will be also a video installation parallel take place at the monument \"Kriegsklotz\u201d not so far from the CCCH ( https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=53.559128&mlon=9.989267&zoom=18 ). The installation will be available during 39C3 every night between 16:00 and 00:00. We recommend taking a look at this installation too.\n",
