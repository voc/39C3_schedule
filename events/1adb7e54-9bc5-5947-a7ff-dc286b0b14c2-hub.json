  "abstract": "3D-Printers have given us all the unprecedented ability to manufacture mechanical parts with a very low barrier to entry.  The only thing between your idea and its physical manifestation is the process of designing the parts. However, this is actually a topic of incredible depth: Design engineering is a whole discipline to itself, built on top of tons and tons of heuristics to produce shapes that are functional, strong, and importantly: well-manufacturable\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present the rules for designing well-printable parts and touch on other areas of design considerations so you can learn to create parts that work first try and can be reproduced by others on their 3d-printers easily.",
  "description": "Over the years, the 3d-printing community has discovered many tricks and rules that help creating parts that can be printed well and fulfill their purpose as best as possible. I started collecting these rules and wrote an article guide to make this knowledge more accessible. I want to present the most important principles and the mindset that is needed to achieve perfected design.\n\nThis is not about how to use a CAD program to design a part \u2014 but rather about the thought process of the design engineer while drawing up a part.  A though process that consists of compromises between many objectives, of heuristic rules, and many neat little tricks.\n\nThe article that this talk is based on can be found on my blog: https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/\n",
