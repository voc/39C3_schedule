  "description": "KinkyGeeks and RopeLabs join forces to host a Beginner Bondage Workshop.\n\nInstructors [@DoodleMe](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/DoodleMe) and [@KnottyLola](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/KnottyLola) will guide you through the foundations of Japanese rope bondage, also known as Shibari.\n\nYou will learn core safety concepts, basic theory, and a small set of beginner-friendly knots. These are practical ties you can use at home and that form the base for more complex work later.\n\nThis is a peer-based workshop aimed at complete beginners. No prior experience is needed. Singles, pairs, and small groups are all welcome.\n\nThe workshop runs in lab mode. There is no sexual content and everyone remains fully clothed. The space is 18+ only.\n\nPlease bring your own non-stretch rope if you have it. Practice rope will be available. Bring a blanket or cushion to sit on the floor comfortably. There is no dress code, but fitted clothing makes tying easier than loose layers.\n\nThe workshop will be taught in English.\n\nPlaces are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person.
