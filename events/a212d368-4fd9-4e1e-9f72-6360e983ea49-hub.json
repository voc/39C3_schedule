  "description": "Some kids have a hard to hold back desire to open and dismantle hardware. While this is usually a hacker parents' nightmare, who wants to find the home sever in pieces, we got the cache to turn it into a learning experience where kids can tear old computers apart and get an explanation what the parts they just unscrewed are used for. Maybe we also put back everything together afterwards and count lost screws.\n",
