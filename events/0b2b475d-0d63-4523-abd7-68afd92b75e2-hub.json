  "description": "**Is That an Off-Grid Server in Your Pocket, or Are You Just Happy to See Me?**\n\n**Materials costs**:  \n\u20ac70\n\n**Taught by** Retia / Brandon.\n\n**Workshop Itinerary**:  Learn how to host your own digital services on hardware small enough to fit in your pocket. Using the D1 Mini, we will deploy a portable, off-grid web server. You\u2019ll learn how to host files, chat applications, or a captive portal that works entirely independently of the internet. Great for digital dead drops or local emergency information sharing.\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: [Reserve Your Seat](https://retia.io/products/39c3-workshop-is-that-an-off-grid-server-in-your-pocket-27-dec-19-30-21-00)\n",
