  "description": "How can we work together to improve political decision-making processes in the long term? What do you want from democracy?\n\nMotivation:\nWhile our democracy can be shaped by the people as they wish on paper, the population seems to be largely dissatisfied with political actions:\n- The handling of many crises appears to be inadequate\n- Urgent problems seem to be postponed\n- Democratic participation seems tedious and ineffective\n\nWe would like to work together to find ways to improve, that can be implemented within the framework of our existing political system.\n\nProcedure:\n- 15 min. presentation on motivation and information\n- 35 min. bug fixing - Moderated discussion round to jointly develop solutions\n",
