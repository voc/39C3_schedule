Come to share the vibe, to browse the amazing tea, to drink a cup or two, to help your neighbors, and take part of something wonderful!\n\nThis first meeting is a good time to learn the basics of the functioning of the House of Tea and how to further participate in helping it run; or just to meet all the fantastic creatures who gravitate around it, and share some delicious tea!\n",
