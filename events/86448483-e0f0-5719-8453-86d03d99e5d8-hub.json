  "abstract": "qaul is a P2P mesh communication app, with a strong focus on privacy and usability. Every user is identified via their self-sovereign cryptographic identity.\r\n\r\nIt not only communicates P2P, but builds a mesh network, interconnecting multiple communication such as BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), Local Area Networks, and Internet overlay links.\r\n\r\nThe messaging app has an automated user discovery, end-to-end encrypted direct messaging and group chats for text, voice-messages and files, as well as public communication channels.\r\n\r\nhttps://qaul.net",
