  "abstract": "We walk from ancient Roman times to modern day, discussing the general advancement of applied cryptography across history. We begin with the Caesar cipher, fast forward to the World Wars of the early 20th century, before moving onto the rise and fall of elliptic curve cryptography, including Monero's past, present, and future protocol design philosophy. This talk is informal, intended as a primer for the historically-minded.",
