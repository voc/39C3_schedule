On top of that, we will try to find out what these might look like in 10 years' time, under both utopian and dystopian conditions. We will work with image and video generators.\n\n> WARNING\n\n\nLink: [https://form-f.net/bugbone.form-f.art](https://form-f.net/bugbone.form-f.art)\n\nInstagram: [@j0.tiff](https://instagram.com/@j0.tiff)\n\nBluesky: [@j0tiff.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/j0tiff.bsky.social)\n\nMastodon: [@Jo_designart@digitalcourage.social](https://digitalcourage.social/@Jo_designart)\n",
