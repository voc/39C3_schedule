We ourselves are Fairphone Angels and will be bringing Fairphone 3, Fairphone 4, and Fairphone 6 along for you to look at and, of course, open up. Feel free to bring other devices too! We will be meeting in a relaxed atmosphere to exchange ideas; there is no planned program. In addition, various custom ROMs will certainly be represented. We welcome any further input! Of course, all creatures are welcome!\n",
