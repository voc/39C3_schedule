  "description": "Computer magazines from the early 2000s, interviews with magical thinking, and the most creative ways to reassure shareholders. The tech industry is full of technoid dreams, advertisements for the future, and error messages in continuous text. In this workshop, we hack these archives analogously: we cut, collage, and remix the old pages into new, poetic forms.\n\nNo prior knowledge is necessary. Scissors, glue and texts are provided (your own finds are welcome). The offered source material will be mostly in German.\n\n\nLink: [https://schneuer.online/blog/workshop-scrapergeist-beim-39c3/](https://schneuer.online/blog/workshop-scrapergeist-beim-39c3/)\n",
