We will be using the USB Nugget to explore sensors with CircuitPython. This is a \"playground\" style class where beginners will learn to write easy Python scripts to interact with hardware buttons, buzzers, LEDs, Lora radios, and more! Whether you want to write a game, a remote control, or a utility, this is the place for beginners to learn Python on microcontrollers.\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or on the website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: [Reserve Your Seat](https://retia.io/products/39c3-workshop-catware-python-sensor-playground-28-dec-23-00-24-30)\n",
