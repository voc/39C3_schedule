  "description": "A meetup for steno enthusiasts, users & those interested in stenography (both machine stenography & shorthand)\n\nThere will be a short introduction presentation on how machine stenography works (specifically the Plover theory, as that is freely available & the one I'm most familiar with), and I'll also bring all my hardware so you can try it out on your own devices - you do need Plover installed on your own laptop though to be able to use that hardware (https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover).\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what kind of hardware & theories others are using, so do bring your things ^^\n\n(If enough people show up we'd just continue after the 25min somewhere else)\n",
