  "description": "The Euclidean Sequencer is a hardware gadget developed by students from Cologne. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, thereby creating a sequence. The sequence can be modified using two potentiometers and can be connected to another sequencer or external devices, such as speakers.\n",
