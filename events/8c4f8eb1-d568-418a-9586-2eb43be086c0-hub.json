You will solder a custom PCB designed to light up and connect a Pusheen cat lamp. Once assembled, we will flash it with WLED, the industry-standard open-source software for controlling addressable LEDs. You\u2019ll leave with a lamp you can control from your phone to display rainbows, fire effects, and notifications. It also doubles as a Wi-Fi defender, with firmware to detect and warn you of the presence of Wi-Fi jamming attacks!\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: [Reserve Your Seat](https://retia.io/products/39c3-workshop-catware-python-sensor-playground-28-dec-23-00-24-30-copy)\n\n**Workshop Includes**: Pusheen Kit (Custom PCB & 3d printed base)\n",
