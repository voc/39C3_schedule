  "description": "There are some version 1.5 and version 2.0 TBD friends badges left to solder. Badges contain blinking lights and 2-way communication, so the badge can tell you if there are friends around that also wear their TBD friends badge.\n\nSoldering is done using solder paste and a hotplate. Takes about 1 hour for beginners (which mainly depends on my divergence when I talk you through it). Record time is 12 minutes.\n\nBadges are donation-ware - Pay whatever you like to TBD. Materials costs are currently about 1.5 euro\n\nIf you miss the scheduled event, contact The0 (DECT or OFTC) - it may be possible to schedule an extra session\n",
