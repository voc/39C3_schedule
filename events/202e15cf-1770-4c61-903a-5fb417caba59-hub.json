  "description": "It is repeatedly becoming public knowledge that the extreme right is also interested in the topic of prepping. However, this is not about a crisis preparedness based on solidarity, but about isolating and protecting their own ethnic families or the German \"Volk\". Far-right online. shops selling prepping supplies try to disguise themselves as harmless survival shops. We want to discuss how to recognize such shops and what exactly far-right crisis narratives are in an accompanied reading corner. You can take a look at the far-right crisis world through primary sources and ask questions or exchange ideas and experiences.\n",
