  "description": "Target Audience:\nOverstimulated brains, conference survivors, and anyone needing 15 minutes of instant clarity.\nFormat:\nGuided Micro-Practice (max. 15 minutes, no talking, just doing).\nDetail:\nThe C3 is an intense sensory overload. This session provides a fast, scientifically grounded reset. We use sound resonance (the 'Om') not for esoteric purposes, but as a focused breathing tool for immediate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Learn how to calm your vagus nerve in under 10 minutes to restore mental clarity and focus. No spiritual content, no prerequisites\u2014just pure pragmatism.\n",
