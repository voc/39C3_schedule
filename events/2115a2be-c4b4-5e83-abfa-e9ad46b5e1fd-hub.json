  "description": "A calm, open-ended programme for curious listening. A shared space where unfamiliar ideas can settle and reveal themselves over time, created by the unfolding of pieces by composers of different eras, schools and genres. Nothing is required beyond a willingness to listen and stay awhile. Well suited to joining the lounge, taking a seat, and discovering something quietly unexpected.\n",
