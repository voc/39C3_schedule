We'll cover how the GDPR screwed up privacy in Portugal and how the law effectively gags the data protection authority, among other outrageous examples. We'll share some of our initial efforts in a data analysis project to correlate public contracts with deployed surveillance systems and we welcome ideas / lessons from others who've engaged in similar initiatives.",
