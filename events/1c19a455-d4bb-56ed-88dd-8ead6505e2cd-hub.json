  "description": "We will teach people how to set up and use TouchDesigner to perform audio analysis and how to draw basic effects and light shows that respond to the beat of the input audio. \nIf you want to follow along, please come with  TouchDesigner preinstalled (the free version is perfectly fine). Recommended on Windows or Mac, but with enough pain it can run under Wine as well.\n",
