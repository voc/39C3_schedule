This beginner soldering class teaches you how to build your own full-featured LoRa mesh node from scratch. We will guide you through basic through-hole and surface-mount soldering techniques to build a custom, cat-shaped node! By the end, you'll have a fully functional node you built with your own hands, capable of running Meshtastic or Meshcore.\n**Note: This is a hardware assembly class; advanced software configuration is covered in the Meshcore classes.**\n\n**Registration**:  \nBuy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.\n\n**Links**: [Reserve Your Seat](https://retia.io/products/39c3-workshop-solder-your-own-meshtastic-meshcore-node-28-dec-10-00-11-30)\n\n**Workshop Includes**: Nibble Connect Unsoldered Kit\n",
