  "description": "Make light sound or mechanical circuits. The electronic building blocks from OEM Dbolo are not only especially child-friendly due to their simple push-button connections but also a lot of fun for all ages. They are distributed by various brands, including \"Kosmos Easy\" and \"Elenco Snap Circuits.\" No prior knowledge of electricity is required, but beware - learning something might happen! This is an open parent-child activity. Learn, build, and play together, and take care for arguments and that the parts don\u2019t fall on the floor. Teenagers and adults are also welcome without child accompaniment. ;-)\n",
