  "description": "The Spectrum is a new queer-feminist, intersectional and transdisciplinary hackspace centering FLINTA+, creatures with disabilities, and other marginalized communities founded in 2025. We see hacking as more than code and machines\u2014it\u2019s a way of exploring the world through curiosity, play, and care. By taking things, systems, and ideas apart, we uncover new perspectives and possibilities for change. Our space is built around awareness, inclusion, and open access to knowledge. We aim to create an environment where everyone can learn, share, and experiment freely\u2014without the constraints of \u201cnormality.\u201d From art and music to activism and technology, The Spectrum brings together diverse disciplines and beings to co-create, collaborate, and imagine better futures.\r\n\r\nAt 39C3, we want to share our experiences of building such a space: how awareness work and accessibility can shape community dynamics, what transdisciplinary hacking can look like, and how centering marginalized perspectives transforms collective creation. Join us to explore what it means to hack not only systems, but also art, expectations, and realities.\r\n\r\nhttps://the-spectrum.space/en/",
