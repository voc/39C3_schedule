        <abstract>While the extreme right is on the rise in many countries and climate change is unrolling, a promising future seems to be written: According to Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and some other “tech bros” it is to leave the dying planet to go to space. With the help of something called “A(G)I”.&#13;
But what kind of future is the one that is promised? And what is the connection between power cycles of tech company owners and people who's believes can be called fascist? As we moved power through data in the hands of very view, it is important to examine what ideas these view have in their heads.&#13;
This talk will explore the roots of today's tech fascism and its love for tech. From the early thoughts and movements in the US and Europe to Futurism and the Holocaust, organised with Hollerith punching cards. It will dive into the its blooming relationship with cybernetics, and take a look in the future the “tech bros” want to lure us in.&#13;
This talk will address the often overlooked topic of how and when people get comfy with diving into movements of hate and how to stop a white supremacy future where we will be sorted by machines.&#13;
And, in taking a look on past movements opposing authoritarianism and will examine mindsets and possibilities of resistance as well as the possibility of restarting everything. Because we have a planet and loved ones to lose.&#13;
Wear your safety cat-ears, buckle up, it will be a wild, but entertaining ride.</abstract>
        <description>The idea of the Super-Human is not a new one, neither is the idea of charismatic „good“ leader nor to sort humans into classes, races, abilities. The idea of a view controlling many by force and ideas that justify their rulership and cruelties is an old one, as is the opposing idea of a free society and humans as equals.
A central aspect is how people involved see the human nature and according to that what society they want to build. And what role is intended for technology.
In the 19th century the beliefs of both the opposing sides dripped into science, as well as individual’s heads, and social movements around the world. While some wanted to form a wold society of equals others wanted to breed a master race that to control everything.

The love of industrial leaders for authoritarianism has played an important role since the beginning in funding and providing access to powerful networks. Industrialists like Henry Ford loved and promoted ideas at least close to fascism. German, Italian, and Austrian counterparts funded Hitler and Mussolini. And it is not that they did it because they did not understand the fascist leader’s yearning – it was because they shared and loved their aims and violence.

In Futurism, one of the often overlooked roots of fascism, and its Manifesto the enemies and societal goals are proclaimed crystal clear: “We will glorify war — the only true hygiene of the world — militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of anarchist, the beautiful Ideas which kill, and the scorn of woman.“

After WWII most of the people believing in dominating others by force and eugenics lived on, they and their cronies had slaughtered millions and destroyed whole social movements were opposing them. These people warning us about authoritarian prophets of doom and concentration camps are still missing.

In the post-war time ideas of authoritarianism met a new player: Cybernetics, the believe in a future, where all problems will be solved through technology and we are “All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace” (Richard Brautigam, 1967). The ideas split, merged, and melted into new beliefs and quasi-religions. Into something that is called “Cyber-Libertarianism” by David Golumbia or “TESCREAL” by Émile P. Torres and Timnit Gebru.

This talk will address an aspect that is often missing in analyses: What kind of breeding ground is it where ideas of fascism hatches best? And how can we stop iFascism instead of participating in it?

Furthermore, as being sorted by machines is not everyone's secret dream, ways to stop iFascism will be provided.

Because we are more, we care for people in need – and we are the chaos!

        <abstract>Building electronics has never been easier, cheaper, or more accessible than the last few years. It's also becoming a precious skill in a world where commercially made electronics are the latest victim of enshittification and vibe coding. And yet, while removing technical and financial barriers to building things, we've not come as far as we should have in removing social barriers. The electronics and engineering industry and the cultures around them are hostile to newcomers and self-taught practitioners, for no good reason at all. I've been teaching advanced electronics manufacturing skills to absolute beginners for a decade now, and they've consistently succeeded at acquiring them. I'm here to tell you why it's not as hard as it seems, how to get into it, and why more people who think they can't should try.</abstract>
        <description>Electronics is easier and more fun to get into than it's ever been before. All the tools and resources are easily accessible and super cheap or free. There's an enormous amount of things to build from and build on.

It's also never been more important to be able to build and understand electronics, as assholes running corporations are wasting their workers' unpaid overtime on making all the electronics in our lives shittier, more full of ads, slop, and spyware, and more frustrating to use. Encountering a device that works for you instead of against you is a breath of fresh air. Building one is an act of resistance and power. Not depending on the whims of corporate assholes is freedom.

However, the culture around electronics and the electronics industry is one of exclusion and gatekeeping. It doesn't need to be. It would be stupidly easy to make things better, and we should. I've been teaching absolute beginners advanced electronics manufacturing skills for many years now. It's absolutely shocking how much more diverse the people who I teach are compared to the industry. The "hardware is hard" meme is true in some cases but toxic when worn as a badge of pride or a warning to people attempting it.

I will tell you why designing and building electronics is not nearly as hard as it seems, how it's almost never been easier to get into it, and why it's very important that people who think or have been told they can't do it should be doing more of it. I'll tell you my experiences of what building devices is like, show and tell a few useful skills, and tell the story of how trying to prove someone wrong on the internet turned into a decade of teaching people with zero experience how to handle the most complex electronic components at all sorts of community events.

        <abstract>Despite how widely used the ESP32 is, its Bluetooth stack remains closed source. Let’s dive into the low-level workings of a proprietary Bluetooth peripheral. Whether you are interested in reverse engineering, Bluetooth security, or just enjoy poking at undocumented hardware, this talk may inspire you to dig deeper.</abstract>
        <description>The ESP32 has become an ubiquitous platform in the hacker and maker communities, powering everything from badges and sensors to mesh networks and custom routers. While its Wi-Fi stack has been the subject of previous reverse engineering efforts, its Bluetooth subsystem remains largely undocumented and closed source despite being present in millions of devices.

This talk presents a reverse engineering effort to document Espressif’s proprietary Bluetooth stack, with a focus on enabling low-level access for researchers, security analysts, and developers to improve existing affordable and open Bluetooth tooling.

The presentation covers the reverse engineering process itself, techniques and the publication of tooling to simplify the process of peripheral mapping, navigating broken memory references and symbol name recovery.

The core of the talk focuses on the internal workings of the Bluetooth peripheral. The reverse engineering effort led to the discovery of the peripheral architecture, it’s memory regions, interrupts and a little bit of information about other related peripherals.

By publishing open tooling, SVD files and other documentation, this work aims to empower researchers, hackers, and developers to build custom Bluetooth stacks, audit existing ones, and repurpose the ESP32 for novel applications. This may interest you if you care about transparency, low-level access, and collaborative tooling.

        <abstract>While trying to apply fault injection to the AMD Platform Security Processor with unusual (self-imposed) requirements/restrictions, it were software bugs which stopped initial glitching attempts. Once discovered, the software bug was used as an entry to explore the target, which in turn lead to uncovering (and exploiting) more and more bugs, ending up in EL3 of the most secure core on the chip.&#13;
This talk is about the story of trying to glitch the AMD Platform Security Processor, then accidentally discovering several bugs and getting a good look inside the target, before returning to trying to hammer it with novel physical strategies.</abstract>
        <description># BACKSTORY
---------------
So here is the backstory of how it all started:
- I bought a commercial gaming console
- Then bought a VR headset (for this console) because of exclusive game
- But also wanted to play beatsaber
- I could, but builtin song selection was very limited
- Custom songs exist (for example on steam), but not for this console
- I didn't want to buy a second headset for steam
  That's when i decided i want to hack this console so that i can port community created customs songs to the console and play them there with the VR headset i already have.

Initially starting with an approach similar to the usual "entrypoint through browser", then go for kernel and call it a day, but quickly annoying hurdles blocked my way. For one, the Hypervisor makes your live just miserable with it's execute only kernel text blind exploitation. Other issues were that one needs to be on latest version to download the game, which exists only as digital purchase title, preventing me to share my efforts with others even if i can get it working on my console.
Though, what finally put the nail in the coffin was when porting a kernel zeroday to the console failed because of heavy sandboxing, unreachable syscalls or even entirely stripped kernel functions. 
Some may call it "skill issue". Anyways, that's when i was full of it and decided to bring this thing down for good.  
Everybody does glitching nowadays and according to rumors people did have success on this thing with glitching before, so how hard can it really be, right?

So the question became: Is it possible to build a modchip, which glitches the board and lets me play beatsaber custom songs?  
Stuff like that has been done on other consoles before (minus the beatsaber part :P)

Turns out that when manufacturing produces chips with broken GPUs, they are sold as spinoff desktop mainboards (with disabled GPU) rather than thrown away. Which is great, because those mainboards are much cheaper, especially if you buy broken spinoff mainboards on ebay.

So on the journey to beatsaber custom songs, breaking this desktop mainboard became a huge chunk of the road. Because if i can glitch this and build a modchip for it, surely i can also do it for the console, right? I mean it's the exact same SoC afterall! 
Back when i started i didn't know i would be about to open pAMDoras box and discover so many bugs and hacks.

# Actual talk description
---------------
**Disclaimer: This is not a console hacking talk!**  
This talk is gonna be about breaking nearly every aspect of the AMD Platform Security Processor of the desktop mainboard with the same SoC as the console. While certainly usefuly for _several_  other AMD targets, unfortunately not every finding can directly be ported to the console. Still, it remains very useful nonetheless!

Note: The final goal of custom songs on beatsaber has not been reached yet, this talk is presenting the current state of things.

In this talk you'll be taken on a ride on how everything started and how almost every aspect of the chip was broken. How bugs were discovered, what strategies were used to move along.  
Not only will several novel techniques be presented for applying existing physical attacks to targets where those couldn't really be applied before, but also completely new approaches are shared which bring a whole different perspective on glitching despite having lots of capacitors (which we don't really want to remove) and extremely powerfull mosfets (which smooth out crowbar attempts in a blink of an eye).

But that's not all!  
While trying to perform physical attacks on the hardware, the software would just start falling apart by itself. Which means, at least **6 unpatchable\* bugs** were discovered, which are gonna be presented in the talk alongside with **5 zero-day exploits**. Getting EL3 code execution on the most secure core inside AMDs SoC? No Problem! 
Apart from just bugs and exploits, many useful techniques and discovery strategies are shared which will provide an excellent knowedgle base and attack inspiration for following along or going for other targets.

        <title>All my Deutschlandtickets gone: Fraud at an industrial scale</title>

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>The Deutschlandticket was the flagship transport policy of the last government, rolled out in an impressive timescale for a political project; but this speed came with a cost - a system ripe for fraud at an industrial scale.&#13;
&#13;
German public transport is famously decentralised, with thousands of individual companies involved in ticketing and operations. Unifying all of these under one national, secure, system has proven a challenge too far for politicians. The end result: losses in the hundreds of millions of Euros, compensated to the transport companies from state and federal budgets to keep the system afloat, and nobody willing to take responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will cover the political, policy, and technical mistakes that lead to this mess; how we can learn from these mistakes; and what we can do to ensure the Deutschlandticket has a viable future.</abstract>
        <description>At last years Congress Q presented [a deep-dive into the technical details of train ticketing](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-what-s-inside-my-train-ticket) and its [Zügli](https://zügli.app) platform for this; since then, things have gone rather out of hand. The little side-project for looking into the details of train tickets turned into a full-time project for detecting ticketing fraud. This talk details an executive summary of the madness that has been the past year, and how we accidentally ended up in national and international politics working to secure the Deutschlandticket.

Shortly after last year's talk, we were contacted about some *interesting* looking tickets someone noticed, issued by the Vetter GmbH Omnibus- und Mietwagenbetrieb - or so they claimed to be. These were normal Deutschlandtickets, but with a few weird mistakes in them. At first, we thought nothing much of it; mistakes happen. But, on further investigation, these turned out to not be legitimate tickets at all, but rather from a fraudulent website by the name of d-ticket.su, using the private signing key obtained under suspicious circumstances. How exactly this key came into the wrong hands remains unclear, but we present the possible explanations for how this could've happened, how many responsible have been thoroughly uncooperative in getting to the bottom of this, and how the supporting systems and processes of the Deutschlandticket were unable to cope with this situation.

Parallel to this, another fraud has been draining the transport companies of their much-needed cash: SEPA Direct Debit fraud. Often, a direct debit payment can be setup online with little more than an IBAN and ticking a box; and most providers of the Deutschlandticket offer an option to pay via direct debit. Fraudsters have noticed this, and mass purchase Deutschlandtickets with invalid or stolen IBANs before flipping them for a discounted price on Telegram; made easier because most transport companies issue a ticket immediately, before the direct debit has been fully processed. The supporting systems of the Deutschlandticket in many cases don't even provide for the revocation of such tickets. We will detail the hallmarks of this fraud, how transport companies can work to prevent it, and how we tracked down the fraudsters by their own careless mistakes.

        <abstract>Might contain zerodays. https://gpg.fail/&#13;
&#13;
From secure communications to software updates: PGP implementations such as *GnuPG* ubiquitously relied on to provide cryptographic assurances. Many applications from secure communications to software updates fundamentally rely on these utilities.&#13;
Since these have been developed for decades, one might expect mature codebases, a multitude of code audit reports, and extensive continuous testing.&#13;
When looking into various PGP-related codebases for some personal use cases, we found these expectations not met, and discovered multiple vulnerabilities in cryptographic utilities, namely in *GnuPG*, *Sequoia PGP*, *age*, and *minisign*.&#13;
The vulnerabilities have implementation bugs at their core, for example in parsing code, rather than bugs in the mathematics of the cryptography itself. A vulnerability in a parser could for example lead to a confusion about what data was actually signed, allowing attackers without the private key of the signer to swap the plain text. As we initially did not start with the intent of conducting security research, but rather were looking into understanding some internals of key management and signatures for personal use, we also discuss the process of uncovering these bugs. Furthermore, we touch on the role of the OpenPGP specification, and the disclosure process.</abstract>
        <description>Beyond the underlying mathematics of cryptographic algorithms, there is a whole other layer of implementation code, assigning meaning to the processed data. For example, a signature verification operation both needs robust cryptography **and** assurance that the verified data is indeed the same as was passed into the signing operation. To facilitate the second part, software such as *GnuPG* implement parsing and processing code of a standardized format. Especially when implementing a feature rich and evolving standard, there is the risk of ambivalent specification, and classical implementation bugs.

The impact of the vulnerabilities we found reaches from various signature verification bypasses, breaking encryption in transit and encryption at rest, undermining key signatures, to exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities.

        <abstract>Seit jetzt schon vier Jahren droht aus der EU die Chatkontrolle. In Deutschland ist das Thema nach den Protesten im Oktober aktueller denn je - und sogar Jens Spahn und Rainer Wendt sind plötzlich gegen diese Form der Überwachung. In diesem Vortrag schauen wir zurück und erklären was, vor allem im Hintergrund, passiert ist. Wir nehmen die Position der Bundesregierung genau unter die Lupe und werfen einen Blick auf die Schritte, die auf EU-Ebene vor uns liegen.</abstract>
        <description>Die Chatkontrolle liest sich mehr wie eine tragische Komödie, als ein Gesetzgebungsverfahren. Nach dem dramaturgischen Rückblick auf dem 37C3 wird es nun Zeit einen Blick auf die Seite der Rebellen zu werfen. 
Markus Reuter und khaleesi haben den Gesetzgebungsprozess rund um die Chatkontrolle von Anfang an eng begleitet, er aus der der journalistischen, sie aus der Policy-Perspektive. 
Nach den ersten Jahren mit großen Rummel und Hollywoodstars ist es nach den EU-Wahlen doch etwas ruhig geworden. Doch die Gefahr ist nicht vom Tisch:

Zwar steht die Position des EU-Parlaments gegen die Chatkontrolle - aber wie sicher sie wirklich ist, ist unklar.
Derzeit hängt alles am Rat: Es gab sehr positive Vorschläge (polnische Ratspräsidentschaft) und negative Vorschläge (dänische Ratspräsidentschaft) - doch einigen können sich die Länder nicht und eine Mehrheit will die Chatkontrolle, kann sich aber nicht durchsetzen.

Und auch in Deutschland hat die Chatkontrolle den ganz großen Sprung in die Öffentlichkeit geschafft und die Gegner:innen einen Etappensieg errungen. Was dieser Erfolg mit der Arbeit der letzten vier Jahre zu tun hat und warum auch in Deutschland noch nichts in trockenen Tüchern ist, erzählen wir in diesem Talk.

        <abstract>Almost everyone has a household appliance at home, whether it's a washing machine, dishwasher, or dryer. Despite their ubiquity, little is publicly documented about how these devices actually work or how their internal components communicate. This talk takes a closer look at proprietary bus systems, hidden diagnostic interfaces, and approaches to cloud-less integration of appliances from two well-known manufacturers into modern home automation systems.</abstract>
        <description>Modern home appliances may seem simple from the outside, but inside they contain complex electronic systems, proprietary communication protocols, and diagnostic interfaces rarely documented outside the manufacturer. In this talk, we'll explore the challenges of reverse-engineering these systems: from analyzing appliance control boards and internal communication buses to decompiling and modifying firmware to better understand device functionality.

We'll also look at the security mechanisms designed to protect diagnostic access and firmware readout, and how these protections can be bypassed to enable deeper insight into device operation. Finally, this talk will demonstrate how the results of this research can be used to integrate even legacy home appliances into popular home automation platforms.

This session combines examples and insights from the reverse-engineering of B/S/H/ and Miele household appliances.

        <abstract>Bluetooth headphones and earbuds are everywhere, and we were wondering what attackers could abuse them for. Sure, they can probably do things like finding out what the person is currently listening to. But what else? During our research we discovered three vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20700, CVE-2025-20701, CVE-2025-20702) in popular Bluetooth audio chips developed by Airoha. These chips are used by many popular device manufacturers in numerous Bluetooth headphones and earbuds.&#13;
&#13;
The identified vulnerabilities may allow a complete device compromise. We demonstrate the immediate impact using a pair of current-generation headphones. We also demonstrate how a compromised Bluetooth peripheral can be abused to attack paired devices, like smartphones, due to their trust relationship with the peripheral.&#13;
&#13;
This presentation will give an overview over the vulnerabilities and a demonstration and discussion of their impact. We also generalize these findings and discuss the impact of compromised Bluetooth peripherals in general. At the end, we briefly discuss the difficulties in the disclosure and patching process. Along with the talk, we will release tooling for users to check whether their devices are affected and for other researchers to continue looking into Airoha-based devices.&#13;
&#13;
Examples of affected vendors and devices are Sony (e.g., WH1000-XM5, WH1000-XM6, WF-1000XM5), Marshall (e.g. Major V, Minor IV), Beyerdynamic (e.g. AMIRON 300), or Jabra (e.g. Elite 8 Active).</abstract>
        <description>Airoha is a vendor that, amongst other things, builds Bluetooth SoCs and offers reference designs and implementations incorporating these chips. They have become a large supplier in the Bluetooth audio space, especially in the area of True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds. Several reputable headphone and earbud vendors have built products based on Airoha’s SoCs and reference implementations using Airoha’s Software Development Kit (SDK).

During our Bluetooth Auracast research we stumbled upon a pair of these headphones. During the process of obtaining the firmware for further research we initially discovered the powerful custom Bluetooth protocol called *RACE*. The protocol provides functionality to take full control of headphones. Data can be written to and read from the device's flash and RAM.

The goal of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, we want to inform about the vulnerabilities. It is important that headphone users are aware of the issues. In our opinion, some of the device manufacturers have done a bad job of informing their users about the potential threats and the available security updates. We also want to provide the technical details to understand the issues and enable other researchers to continue working with the platform. With the protocol it is possible to read and write firmware. This opens up the possibility to patch and potentially customize the firmware.

Secondly, we want to discuss the general implications of compromising Bluetooth peripherals. As smart phones are becoming increasingly secure, the focus for attackers might shift to other devices in the environment of the smart phone. For example, when the Bluetooth Link Key, that authenticates a Bluetooth connection between the smart phone and the peripheral is stolen, an attacker might be able to impersonate the peripheral and gain its capabilities.

        <abstract>In unserer „Unnecessarily Complicated Kitchen“ hacken wir die Gesetze der Kulinarik. Ich zeige live, wie Hitze, Chemie und Chaos zusammenwirken, wenn Moleküle tanzen, Dispersionen emulgieren und Geschmack zu Wissenschaft wird. Zwischen Pfanne und Physik entdecken wir, warum Kochen im Grunde angewandtes Debugging ist – und wie man Naturgesetze so würzt, dass sie schmecken.</abstract>
        <description>Willkommen in der „Unnecessarily Complicated Kitchen“ – einer Küche, in der Naturwissenschaft, Technik und kulinarisches Chaos aufeinandertreffen.
Wir sezieren das Kochen aus der Perspektive von Hacker*innen: Warum Hitzeübertragung ein deinen Tschunk kühlt, warum Emulsionen wie BGP funktionieren und wie sich die Kunst des Abschmeckens in Datenpunkten erklären lässt.

In diesem Talk verbinden wir naturwissenschaftliche Experimente mit kulinarischer Praxis. Wir erhitzen, rühren, messen und analysieren – live auf der Bühne. Dabei übersetzen wir Physik und Chemie in Geschmack, Textur und Aha-Momente.
Kochen wird so zum Laborversuch, zum Hack, zum Reverse Engineering des guten Geschmacks.

Ich zeige, dass hinter jeder gelungenen Marinade ein Protokoll steckt, hinter jeder Soße ein Algorithmus – und dass man auch in der Küche mit Trial &amp; Error, Open Source und einer Prise Chaos zu erstaunlichen Ergebnissen kommt.

Am Ende steht nicht nur Erkenntnis, sondern auch Genuss: Denn wer versteht, warum etwas schmeckt, kann die Regeln brechen – und sie dabei besser würzen.

        <abstract>Typography is the art of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. However, for the neophyte, typography is mostly apprehended as the juxtaposition of characters displayed on the screen while for the expert, typography means typeface, scripts, unicode, glyphs, ascender, descender, tracking, hinting, kerning, shaping, weigth, slant, etc. Typography is actually much more than the mere rendering of glyphs and involves many different concepts. If glyph rendering is an important part of the rendering pipeline, it is nonetheless important to have a basic understanding of typography or there’s a known risk at rendering garbage on screen, as it has been seen many times in games, software and operating systems.</abstract>
        <description>Text is everywhere in our modern digital life and yet, no one really pay attention to how it is rendered on a screen. Maybe this is a sign that problem has been solved. But it isn't. A few people are still looking at the best way to display text on any devices &amp; any languages. This talk is based on a lesson I gave at SIGGRAPH  a few years ago (https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/siggraph-2018-digital-typography/110385070) to explain rendering techniques and concepts.

        <abstract>Despite how it's often portrayed in blogs, scientific articles, or corporate test planning, fuzz testing isn't a magic bug printer; just saying "we fuzz our code" says nothing about how _effectively_ it was tested. Yet, how fuzzers and programs interact is deeply mythologised and poorly misunderstood, even by seasoned professionals. This talk analyses a number of recent works and case studies that reveal the relationship between fuzzers, their inputs, and programs to explain _how_ fuzzers work.</abstract>
        <description>Fuzz testing (or, "fuzzing") is a testing technique that passes randomly-generated inputs to a subject under test (SUT). This term was first coined in 1988 by Miller to describe sending random byte sequences to Unix utilities (1), but was arguably preceded in 1971 by Breuer for fault detection in sequential circuits (2) and in 1972 by Purdom for parser testing by generating sentences from grammars (3). Curiously, they all exhibit different approaches for generating inputs based on knowledge about the SUT, though none of them use feedback from the SUT to make decisions about new inputs.

Fuzzing wasn't yet popular, but industry was catching on. Between the late 90s and 2013, we see a number of strategies appear in industry (4). Some had success with constraint solvers, where they would observe runtime behavior or have knowledge about a target's structure to produce higher quality inputs. Others operated in a different way, by taking an existing input and tweaking it slightly ("mutating") to address the low-likelihood of random generation to produce structured inputs. None was as successful, or as popular, as American Fuzzy Lop, or "AFL", released in 2013. This combined coverage observations for inputs (Ormandy, 2007) with concepts from evolutionary novelty search (5) into a tool which could, from very few initial inputs, _evolve_ over multiple mutations to find new, untested code.

Despite its power, this advancement made it far more difficult to understand how fuzzers even worked. Now all you had to do was point this tool at a program and it would start testing, and the coverage would go up; users were now only responsible for writing "harnesses", code which processed fuzzer-produced inputs and sent them to the SUT. Though there have been a few real advances to fuzzing since (or, at least, strategies which combined previous methods more effectively), fuzzing research has mostly deadended, with new methods squeezing only minor improvements out of older ones. This, and inadequate harness writing, comes from this opaqueness in how fuzzers internally operate: without understanding what these tools do from first principles, there's no clear "right" and "wrong" way to do things because there is no mental model to test them against.

This talk doesn't talk about new bugs, new fuzzers, or new harness generation tools. The purpose of this talk is to uncover mechanisms of fuzzer input production in the context of different classes of SUT and harnesses thereon, highlighting recent papers which have clarified our understanding of how fuzzers and SUTs interact. By the end, you will have a better understanding of _why_ modern fuzzers work, _what_ their limitations are, and _how_ you can write better fuzzers and harnesses yourself.

        <abstract>Die Legalisierung des Online-Glücksspiels in Deutschland im Jahr 2021 und die zunehmende Normalisierung von Glücksspiel und Sportwetten in den Medien haben ein Umfeld geschaffen, in welchem Glücksspielprodukte leichter zugänglich und gesellschaftlich stärker akzeptiert sind als je zuvor. Diese weit verbreitete Exposition birgt erhebliche Risiken für vulnerable Personen, insbesondere da die Grenzen zwischen Spielen und Glücksspiel zunehmend verwischen. Seit einiger Zeit ist beispielsweise ein deutlicher Anstieg von Spielen zu beobachten, die Glücksspiel-ähnliche Items wie Loot-Boxen beinhalten. Komplexe Designmerkmale in elektronischen Glücksspielprodukten, z.B. Glücksspielautomaten und Online-Slots, sind gezielt darauf ausgerichtet, Individuen zu verlängerten Spielsitzungen zu motivieren, um den Umsatz zu maximieren. Während Glücksspiel für viele Menschen eine Form der Unterhaltung darstellt, kann das Spielverhalten bei manchen eskalieren und schwerwiegende Folgen für das Leben der Betroffenen haben. Dieser Vortrag wird Mechanismen in Glücksspielprodukten und Loot Boxen beleuchten und aufzeigen, weshalb diese Merkmale das Suchtpotenzial fördern können. Hierbei spielen Mechanismen des sogenannten Verstärkungslernens (engl. Reinforcement Learning) eine Rolle, die das menschliche Belohnungssystem aktivieren, also dopaminerge Bahnen, welche an der Vorhersage von Belohnungen beteiligt sind. Besonderes Augenmerk liegt auf dem Reinforcement-Learning, einem Framework zur Modellierung von Lernen durch belohnungsbasiertes Feedback, welches sowohl in der Psychologie zur Beschreibung menschlichen Lernens und Entscheidungsverhaltens als auch zur Optimierung von Machine-Learning-Algorithmen eingesetzt wird. Im Vortrag werden auch Ergebnisse aus eigener Forschung am Labor der Universität zu Köln vorgestellt. Ziel ist es, Mechanismen des Glücksspiels zu erklären, sowie das Bewusstsein für potenzielle Schäden für Individuen und die Gesellschaft zu schärfen und die Notwendigkeit von Regulation sowie verantwortungsbewussten Designpraktiken zu diskutieren.</abstract>
        <description>In diesem Vortrag wird beleuchtet, wie moderne Glücksspielprodukte und glücksspielähnliche Spielmechaniken, etwa Lootboxen, gezielt psychologische und neurobiologische Lernprozesse ausnutzen, um Umsatz durch längeres Spielen und stärkere Interaktion zu generieren. Im Fokus stehen dabei Mechanismen des Verstärkungslernens (Reinforcement Learning) und deren Zusammenspiel mit dem dopaminergen Belohnungssystem. Anhand aktueller Forschungsergebnisse werden Designstrategien vorgestellt, die das Suchtpotenzial von Glücksspielen erhöhen können. Ziel des Vortrags ist es, ein wissenschaftlich fundiertes Verständnis dieser Dynamiken zu vermitteln, Risiken für Individuen und Gesellschaft aufzuzeigen und die Notwendigkeit von Regulierung und verantwortungsvollem Design zu diskutieren.

        <abstract>Ihr macht eine Veranstaltung für viele Menschen? Dann haben viele Menschen auch viel Hunger.&#13;
Jetzt wird euch gezeigt wie man für viele (mehr als 75) Menschen Essen zubereitet.&#13;
Es braucht nur etwas Vorbereitung und Motivation!</abstract>
        <description>Bei vielen Zeltlagern, Sommerfesten, ICMP, Village beim Chaos-Camp und ähnlichem habe ich gelernt wie man für viele Menschen kochen kann und wie nicht. Damit Du nicht die gleiche Lernkurve machen musst, möchte ich Dir zeigen mit welchen Überlegungen Du mit 2-3 Freunden Essen für viele Menschen zubereiten kannst.

Planen, einkaufen, Logistik, vorbereiten, kochen, Hygiene, servieren und aufräumen, das kann jeder. 
Das so zu machen das es Spaß macht, sich nicht nach Arbeit anfühlt und dann auch noch allen schmeckt, das möchte ich Dir mit diesem Vortrag vermitteln.

Wenn dein Space in Zukunft ein großes Event plant und Du darüber nachdenkst ob man vor Ort kochen kann und will, dann komme vorbei und lass Dir zeigen was man dafür braucht und wie das geht.

        <abstract>From the EU’s “Chat Control” to the UK’s age verification, there is a growing legislative momentum across jurisdictions to regulate the Internet in the name of protecting children. The monstrosity of child sexual abuse looms large in shaping how policymakers, advocates, and the public understand the problem area of and propose solutions for detecting, reporting, and removing harmful/illegal content. Children’s safety and adults’ privacy are thus pitted against each other, deadlocked into an impasse. As technologists deeply concerned with safety and privacy, where do we go from here?</abstract>
        <description>There is a path forward! Many, in fact. But the impasse framing seriously limits how policymakers, technologists, advocates, and our communities understand child sexual abuse (CSA). We need informed, principled, and bold alternatives to policing-driven tech solutions like client-side scanning and grooming classifiers. To effectively and humanely break the cycles of abuse that enables CSA in our communities, we have to think beyond criminalization. This talk will unpack how and why this impasse framing exists, how it constrains us from candidly engaging with the complexity of CSA. Drawing from scientific and clinical research and informed by transformative justice approaches, I detail what CSA is, how and why it happens offline and online, and why the status quo of detection and criminalization does not work. Ultimately, I argue that effective, humane, and collective interventions require protecting the safety and privacy of all those harmed by CSA, and that this creates a unique role for technologists to play.

        <title>Of Boot Vectors and Double Glitches: Bypassing RP2350's Secure Boot</title>

        <abstract>In August 2024, Raspberry Pi released their newest MCU: The RP2350. Alongside the chip, they also released the RP2350 Hacking Challenge: A public call to break the secure boot implementation of the RP2350. This challenge concluded in January 2025 and led to five exciting attacks discovered by different individuals.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, we will provide a technical deep dive in the RP2350 security architecture and highlight the different attacks. Afterwards, we talk about two of the breaks in detail---each of them found by one of the speakers. In particular, we first discuss how fault injection can force an unverified vector boot, completely bypassing secure boot. Then, we showcase how double glitches enable direct readout of sensitive secrets stored in the one-time programmable memory of the RP2350.&#13;
&#13;
Last, we discuss the mitigation of the attacks implemented in the new revision of the chip and the lessons we learned while solving the RP2350 security challenge. Regardless of chip designer, manufacturer, hobbyist, tinkerer, or hacker: this talk will provide valuable insights for everyone and showcase why security through transparency is awesome.</abstract>
        <description>The RP2350 is one of the first generally available microcontrollers with active security-features against fault-injection such as glitch-detectors, the redundancy co-processor, and other pieces to make FI attacks more difficult.

But security on paper often does not mean security in real-life. Luckily for us, Raspberry Pi also ran the RP2350 Hacking Challenge: A public bug bounty that has exactly these attacks in-scope. During the hacking challenge 5 different attacks were found on the secure-boot process - one of which was shown at 38C3 by Aedan Cullen.

In this talk, we talk about all successful attacks - including laser fault-injection, a reset glitch, and a double-glitch during execution of the bootrom - to show all the different ways in which a chip can be attacked.

We also talk about the awesomeness of an open security-ecosystem for chips: Raspberry Pi was very transparent on the findings, and worked with researchers to improve the new revision of the chip.

        <abstract>Wenn die Regierung sich nicht mehr an das eigene Recht gebunden fühlt, markiert das nicht nur einen politischen Spurwechsel, sondern die Auffahrt auf den Highway to Trumpism. Zeit die Notbremse zu ziehen!&#13;
Normalerweise trifft es in solchen Situationen immer zuerst diejenigen, die sich am wenigsten wehren können. Doch was passiert, wenn genau diese Menschen mit juristischen Werkzeugen bewaffnet werden, um zurückzuschlagen?&#13;
Anhand von über 100 Klagen afghanischer Schutzsuchender zeigen wir, wie Ministerien das Bundesaufnahmeprogramm sabotieren, Gerichte sie zurückpfeifen – und die Zivilgesellschaft zum letzten Schutzwall des Rechtsstaats wird. Und wir verraten, warum sich Beamte im BAMF vielleicht lieber krankmelden sollten und welche anderen Möglichkeiten sie haben, um nicht straffällig zu werden.</abstract>
        <description>•	Versprochen ist versprochen und wird auch nicht gebrochen“ – das lernen wir schon als Kinder. Aber der Kindergarten ist schon lange her, und Politiker*innen haben zwar oft das Auftreten eines Elefanten, aber das Gedächtnis eines Goldfischs.
•	Deswegen hätte die Bundesregierung auch fast 2.500 Afghan*innen mit deutschen Aufnahmezusagen in Islamabad „vergessen“, die dort seit Monaten auf die Ausstellung ihrer deutschen Visa warten
•	Das Kalkül dahinter: Pakistan erledigt die Drecksarbeit und schiebt sie früher oder später ab, Problem solved! - selbst wenn dabei Menschenleben auf dem Spiel stehen.
•	Wie kann die Zivilgesellschaft die Notbremse ziehen, wenn sich Regierung und Verwaltung nicht mehr an das eigene Recht gebunden fühlen?
•	Eine Möglichkeit: wir vernetzen die afghanischen Familien mit Anwält*innen, damit sie Dobrindt und Wadephul verklagen - und sie gewinnen! Die Gerichtsbeschlüsse sind eindeutig: Visa sofort erteilen – sonst Strafzahlungen! Inzwischen laufen über 100 Verfahren an vier Verwaltungsgerichten, weitere kommen täglich hinzu. 
•	Das dürfte nicht ganz das gewesen sein, was die neue Bundesregierung meinte, als sie im Koalitionsvertrag verkündete, „freiwillige Aufnahmeprogramme so weit wie möglich zu beenden“. 
Übersetzung der politischen Realitätsversion: Wenn es nach Dobrindt und dem Kanzler geht, sollen möglichst gar keine Schutzsuchenden aus Afghanistan mehr nach Deutschland kommen – rechtsverbindliche Aufnahmezusagen hin oder her. Einreisen dürfen nur noch anerkannte Terroristen aus der Taliban-Regierung, um hier in Deutschland die afghanischen Botschaften und Konsulate zu übernehmen
•	Durch die Klagen konnten bereits 78 Menschen einreisen, etwa 80 weitere Visa sind in Bearbeitung – und weitere werden vorbereitet.
•	Doch wie in jedem Drehbuch gilt: The Empire strikes back! Die Regierung entwickelt laufend neue Methoden, um Urteile ins Leere laufen zu lassen und Einreisen weiterhin zu blockieren.
•	Willkommen im „Trumpismus made in Germany“.

        <abstract>With PTP 1588, AES67, and SMPTE 2110, we can transmit synchronous audio and video with sub-millisecond latency over the asynchronous medium Ethernet. But how do you make hundreds of devices agree on the exact same nanosecond on a medium that was never meant to care about time?&#13;
Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588) tries to do just that. It's the invisible backbone of realtime media standards like AES67 and SMPTE 2110, proprietary technologies such as Dante, and even critical systems powering high-frequency trading, cellular networks, and electric grids.</abstract>
        <description>Where even a few microseconds of drift can turn perfect sync into complete chaos.
This talk takes a deep dive into the mysterious world of precise time distribution in large networks. We’ll start by exploring how PTP 1588 actually works, from announce, sync, and follow-up messages to delay measurements and the magic of hardware timestamping. We’ll look at why PTP is critical for modern audio/video-over-IP standards like AES67 and SMPTE 2110, and how they push Ethernet to its absolute temporal limits.
Along the way, we’ll discover how transparent and boundary clocks fight jitter, and why your switch’s buffer might secretly hate you. We will do live Wireshark dissections of real PTP traffic, demos showing what happens when timing breaks, and some hands-on hardware experiments with grandmasters and followers trying to stay in sync.
Expect packets, graphs, oscilloscopes, crashing live demos and at least one bad joke about time travel.

Social Media wird derzeit mit rechtem KI-Slop geflutet, in dem wahlweise die Welt dank Migration kurz vor dem Abgrund steht oder blonde, weiße Familien fröhlich Fahnen schwenken. Im politischen Vorfeld der extremen Rechten werden zudem immer häufiger mal mehr oder weniger offensichtliche Deepfakes geteilt, die auf die jeweilige politische Botschaft einzahlen. Das reicht von KI-generierten Straßenumfragen über Ausschnitte aus Talksendungen, die nie stattgefunden haben, bis hin zu gänzlich KI-generierten Influencerinnen (natürlich blond).  Was macht das mit politischen Debatten? Und wie sollten wir als Gesellschaft damit umgehen?

        <abstract>Presenting FEX, a translation layer to run x86 apps and games on ARM devices: Learn why x86 is such a pain to emulate, what tricks and techniques make your games fly with minimal translation overhead, and how we are seamless enough that you'll forget what CPU you're using in the first place!</abstract>
        <description>ARM-powered hardware in laptops promises longer battery life at the same compute performance as before, but a translation layer like FEX is needed to run existing x86 software. We'll look at the technical challenges involved in making this possible: designing a high-performance binary recompiler, translating Linux system calls across architectures, and forwarding library calls to their ARM counterparts.

Gaming in particular poses extreme demands on FEX and raises further questions: How do we enable GPU acceleration in an emulated environment? How can we integrate Wine to run Windows games on Linux ARM? Why is Steam itself the ultimate boss battle for x86 emulation? And why in the world do we care more about page sizes than German standardization institutes?

This talk will be accessible to a technical audience and gaming enthusiasts alike. However, be prepared to learn cursed knowledge you won't be able to forget!

        <abstract>I successfully failed with a literature related project and accidentally built a ChatGPT detector. Then I spoke to the people who uploaded ChatGPT generated content on Wikipedia.</abstract>
        <description>It began as a standard maintenance project: I wanted to write a tool to find and fix broken ISBN references in Wikipedia. Using the built-in checksum, this seemed like a straightforward technical task. I expected to find mostly typos. But I also found texts generated by LLMs. These models are effective at creating plausible-sounding content, but (for now) they often fail to generate correct checksums for identifiers like ISBNs. This vulnerability turned my tool into an unintentional detector for this type of content. This talk is the story of that investigation. I'll show how the tool works and how it identifies this anti-knowledge. But the tech is only half the story. The other half is human. I contacted the editors who had added this undeclared AI content. I will talk about why they did it and how the Wikipedians reacted and whether "The End is Nigh" calls might be warranted.

        <title>A Tale of Two Leaks: How Hackers Breached the Great Firewall of China</title>

        <abstract>The Great Firewall of China (GFW) is one of, if not arguably the most advanced Internet censorship systems in the world. Because repressive governments generally do not simply publish their censorship rules, the task of determining exactly what is and isn’t allowed falls upon the censorship measurement community, who run experiments over censored networks. In this talk, we’ll discuss two ways censorship measurement has evolved from passive experimentation to active attacks against the Great Firewall.</abstract>
        <description>While probing the Great Firewall’s DNS injection system in 2021, we noticed something strange: Sometimes the injected responses contained weird garbage. After some investigation, we realized we’d stumbled onto a memory disclosure vulnerability that would give us an unprecedented window into the Great Firewall’s internals: Wallbleed.

So we crafted probes that could leak up to 125 bytes per response and repeatedly sent them for two years. Five billion responses later, the picture that emerged was... concerning. Over 2 million HTTP cookies leaked. Nearly 27,000 URL parameters with passwords. SMTP commands exposing email addresses. We found traffic from RFC 1918 private addresses - suggesting we were seeing the Great Firewall’s own internal network. We saw x86_64 stack frames with ASLR-enabled pointers. We even sent our own tagged traffic into China and later recovered those exact bytes in Wallbleed responses, proving definitively that real user traffic was being exposed.

In September 2023, the patching began. We watched in real-time as blocks of IP addresses stopped responding to our probes. But naturally the same developers that made this error in the first place made further mistakes. Within hours, we developed “Wallbleed v2” queries that still triggered the leak. The vulnerability persisted for another six months until March 2024.

GFW measurement research went back to business as usual until September of this year when an anonymous source released 600GB of leaked source code, packages, and documentation via Enlace Hacktivista. This data came from Geedge Networks - a company closely connected to the GFW and the related MESA lab. Geedge Networks develops censorship software not only for the GFW but also for other repressive countries such as Pakistan, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, and Ethiopia.

We will discuss some of our novel findings from the Geedge Networks leak, including new insights about how the leak relates to Wallbleed.

Wallbleed and the Geedge Networks leak show that censorship measurement research can be about more than just actively probing censored networks. We hope this talk will be a call to arms for hackers against Internet censorship.

        <abstract>Like 39C3, the last CCC camp (2023) and congress (38C3) have seen volunteer-driven deployments of legacy ISDN and POTS networks using a mixture of actual legacy telephon tech and custom open source software. This talk explains how this is achieved, and why this work plays an important role in preserving parts of our digital communications heritage.</abstract>
        <description>Just like at this very event (39C3), the last few years a small group of volunteers has delpoyed and operated legacy telephony networks for ISDN (digital) and POTS (analog) services at CCC-camp2023 and 38C3. Anyone on-site can obtain subscriber lines (POTS, ISDN BRI or PRI service) and use them for a variety of services, including telephony, fax machines, modem dial-up into BBSs as well as dial-up internet access and video telephony.

These temporary event networks are not using soft-PBX or VoIP, but are built using actual de-commissioned hardware from telecom operators, including a Siemens EWSD digital telephone exchange, Nokia EKSOS V5 access multiplexers, a SDH ring for transporting E1 carriers and much more.

While some may enjoy this for the mere hack value, others enjoy it to re-live the digital communication sear of their childhood or youth.  Howevre, there is a more serious aspect to this: The preservation and restoration of early digital communications infrastructure from the 1970s to 1990s, as well as how to operate such equipment.  As part of this effort, we have already been able to help communications museums to fill gaps in their collections.

The talk will cover
* the equipment used,
* the network hierarchy we build,
* the services operated
* the lessons learnt
* newly-written open source software for interfacing retro telcommunications gear

        <abstract>This project transforms a classic rotary phone into a mobile device. Previous talks have analyzed various aspects of analogue phone technology, such as rotary pulse detection or ringing voltage generation. Now this project helps you get rid of the cable: it equips the classic German FeTAp 611 with battery power and a flyback SMPS based ringing voltage generator - but still maintains the classical look and feel. The talk demonstrates the journey of bridging analog and digital worlds, explaining how careful design connects a vintage phone to today’s mobile environment - in a way that will make your grandparents happy.</abstract>
        <description>There are people who throw away old telephones - and then there are those who find them in the garbage and think, „How can a microcontroller actually read the digits from a rotary dial?“
This talk follows the journey of transforming a classic German FeTAp 611 rotary phone into a mobile device while keeping its vintage charm. Building on earlier retrofits, this project aims to combine the following design goals into a mobile version of the Fernsprechtischapparat:

- Grandparents-compatible – The phone shall be easy to use by non-technical people, showing the same look and feel as the original phones, including details such as a dial tone.
- easy phone switching – Switching between FeTAp and regular cellphone shall not require unscrewing the phone to switch SIM cards.
- standard components – PCB/PCBA suppliers shall be capable of manufacturing boards at a reasonable price.
- device-agnostic circuit design – Adapting to different phones (e.g. W48, FeTAp 791, FeTAp 611) shall minimize the need for changes in the schematic. This includes a ringing voltage generator that shall be powerful enough to drive an old W48 phone.

This talk will walk you through certain aspects of the German analog telephony standard 1TR110-1, and the challenges faced when implementing those on a battery-powered device with little space. It explains
- the state machine implemented on an STM32 microcontroller,
- how to connect old carbon microphones to modern audio electronics,
- designing (and avoiding mistakes in) a flyback based SMPS to generate 32V - 75V ringing voltage,
- how to generate 25 Hz AC using an H-bridge,
- and how to layout the PCB such that the ancient second handset connector can now be used for USB-C charging.

In the course of the development, I discovered that the project is not only a good way to get a glimpse into various aspects of ancient and modern types of electronics - but also into people’s reactions when such a phone suddenly starts ringing on a flea market… :-)

        <abstract>Did you ever wonder where all the drugs, which you can get at a pharmacy, come from? Who makes them, and how? Well, there is no easy answer, because the process of drug discovery and development is a very complex, expensive, and challenging journey, riddled with many risks and failures. This holds true for all types of drugs, from a simple pill to an mRNA vaccine or a gene therapy. Today, scientists support this process with a variety of AI applications, cutting-edge technologies, automation, and a huge amount of data. But can the race for new medicines and cures succeed only through more technology, or do we need to rethink the entire process? Let’s take a look at how the drug discovery and development process has worked so far, and how this entire process is changing – for better or worse.</abstract>
        <description>After presenting a high-level overview of the path from an idea to the medicine that you can buy at a pharmacy, this talk will present and discuss the following aspects of the drug discovery and development process:
(1) The translation of an idea into a drug for a human patient faces many critical moments along the development process. This so-called “translational gap” is addressed through experiments in a test tube (or Petri dish), experimentation in lab animals, and eventually testing in humans. However, findings in a standard cell line or in a mouse do not necessarily reflect the complexity of biological processes in a human patient. Currently, there are many technological advancements under way to improve the current drug discovery and development process, and possibly even replace animal studies in the future (e.g., organs-on-chip). Nevertheless, the fundamental issues surrounding translational research remain, such as the lack of standardization, the limitations of model systems, and various underlying clinical biases.
(2) Like in many industries today, AI applications are introduced at multiple levels and for various purposes within the drug discovery and development continuum. Often, a lot of hope is placed in AI-based technologies to accelerate the R&amp;D process, increase efficiency and productivity, and identify new therapeutic approaches. Indeed, there are many highly useful examples, such as the automation of image analysis in research, which replaces repetitive tasks and hence frees up a lot of time for researchers to do meaningful research. However, there are also many applications that are likely misguided, because they still face fundamental problems in evaluating scientific knowledge. For instance, the use of LLMs to summarize huge amounts of very complex and heterogeneous scientific data relies on the accuracy, completeness, and reproducibility of the available scientific data, which is often not the case. In addition, AI is often employed in an IT environment with questionable data security and ownership practices, such as the storage of sensitive research data on third-party cloud platforms.
(3) Until now, the overwhelming majority of drugs have been developed to treat large patient populations, which represent a considerable market and ultimately ensure a return on investment. Today, however, most common and homogeneous diseases can already be managed, often with several (generic) drugs. Slight improvements to current drugs do not justify a large profit margin anymore, so the focus of drug discovery and development is shifting toward more heterogeneous and rare diseases, for which no or only poor treatments are available. Novel medicines in those disease areas hold the promise of substantial improvement for patients; however, these new patient (sub)populations, and thus markets, are much smaller, leading to premium prices for individualized therapies in order to ensure a return on investment. This paradigm shift toward individualized therapy - referred to as precision and personalized medicine - is supported by the advent of novel technologies and the accumulation of large bodies of data.
(4) The rise of precision and personalized medicine is challenging the current business model of today’s pharmaceutical industry, suggesting that the era of blockbuster drugs might be over. Moreover, many intellectual property rights for blockbuster drugs are going to expire in the next few years, ending the market dominance of a number of pharma companies and sending the current industry landscape into turmoil. These developments will likely alter the current modus operandi of the entire biopharmaceutical development process, and it is not clear how the next few years will look like.

        <abstract>Zwei Jahre nach dem ersten KIM-Vortrag auf dem 37C3: Die gezeigten Schwachstellen wurden inzwischen geschlossen. Weiterhin können mit dem aktuellen KIM 1.5+ nun große Dateien bis 500 MB übertragen werden, das Signaturhandling wurde für die Nutzenden vereinfacht, indem die Detailinformationen der Signatur nicht mehr einsehbar sind. Aber ist das System jetzt sicher oder gibt es neue Probleme?</abstract>
        <description>KIM hat sich als Dienst für medizinische E-Mails etabliert: Elektronische Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigungen (eAU), zahnärztliche Heil- und Kostenpläne, Laborinformationen, und Medikamentendosierungen sollen sicher per KIM übermittelt werden. Die Sicherheit soll unauffällig und automatisiert im Hintergrund, ohne Interaktion mit den Benutzenden gewährleistet werden. Dazu werden die Ver- und Entschlüsselung sowie die Signierungsfunktionalitäten in einer extra Software, dem sogenannten Clientmodul, abstrahiert.

In diesem Vortrag wird das Design dieser Sicherheits-Abstraktion und dadurch bedingte Schwachstellen, wie das Fälschen oder Entschlüsseln von KIMs, beleuchtet.

        <abstract>Großen Herausforderungen im Gesundheitswesen soll mittels Technik und Eigenverantwortung begegnet werden. Die Hoffnung: „KI“ und Digitalisierung machen das System effizienter; Selbstoptimierung und mehr Eigenverantwortung halten die Menschen länger gesund. Der Vortrag analysiert aktuelle Diskurse rund um Digitalisierung und Gesundheit, und fragt kritisch, wie diese Entwicklung ohnehin bestehende soziale Ungleichheiten verschärfen könnte. Am Ende bleibt die Frage: Wie könnten tragfähige Lösungen fürs Gesundheitssystem aussehen?</abstract>
        <description>In der Analyse sind sich alle einig: Das Gesundheitssystem steht vor großen Herausforderungen, die von explodierenden Kosten, wachsenden Zugangsbarrieren bis hin zum anstehenden demographischen Wandel reichen: viele Menschen werden alt und kränker, während gleichzeitig sehr viele Mitarbeiter:innen des Gesundheitswesens in Rente gehen. Wir brauchen also Lösungen fürs Gesundheitssystem, die nachhaltig tragen und Menschenwürde ermöglichen.

Während ganz unterschiedliche Lösungsansätze diskutiert werden, taucht ein Narrativ immer wieder auf: Dass Digitalisierung durch massive Effizienzgewinne die bestehenden Probleme im Gesundheitswesen fixen werden: Dank „KI“ sollen Menschen weniger häufig Ärzt:innen brauchen, zum Beispiel, indem durch Symptomchecker und Co vorgefiltert wird, wer wirklich behandelt werden muss, und wer nicht. Manche behaupten, dass Hausärzt:innen künftig ein vielfaches an Patient:innen behandeln könnten, wenn nur die richtigen technischen Hilfsmittel gefunden wurden. Und längst befinden wir uns tatsächlich in einer Realität, in der Chats mit LLMs an vielen Stellen zumindest Dr. Google ersetzt haben.

Weitere Lösungsansätze zielen auf mehr Eigenverantwortung ab: "Longevity" ist das Trendwort in aller Munde. Ein Ansatz der „Langlebigkeit“, der maßgeblich durch technische 
Maßnahmen gestützt sein soll: Selbstoptimierung per App, „KI“ als individueller Gesundheitsassistent und allerlei experimentelle Untersuchungen. Die Grundidee: Wenn Menschen länger gesund bleiben und leben, wird das Gesundheitssystem weniger belastet, während Menschen länger zu Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft beitragen können. Die ideologischen Grundzüge und Geschäftsmodelle der „Longevity“ kommen aus den USA, von Tech-Milliardären und ihren Unsterblichkeitsfantasien bis hin zu wenig seriösen Gesundheitsinfluencer:innen, die am Ende oft mehr schaden als dass sie zu einem größeren Wohlbefinden ihrer Kund:innen beitragen würden - und trotzdem hunderttausende auf Social Media in ihren Bann ziehen.

Der Vortrag zieht Verbindungslinien zwischen naiver Technikgläubigkeit, aktuellen Diskursen im Gesundheitswesen, ihren fragwürdigen ideologischen Wurzeln und der Frage, wie wir Herausforderungen und insbesondere sozialen Ungleichheiten im Feld der Gesundheit wirklich effektiv begegnen.

        <abstract>A 595€ wheelchair remote that sends a handful of Bluetooth commands. A 99.99€ app feature that does exactly what the 595€ hardware does. A speed upgrade from 6 to 8.5 km/h locked behind a 99.99€ paywall - because apparently catching the bus is a premium feature.&#13;
&#13;
Welcome to the wonderful world of DRM in assistive devices, where already expensive basic mobility costs extra and comes with in-app purchases! And because hackers gonna hack, this just could not be left alone.</abstract>
        <description>This talk depicts the reverse engineering of a popular electric wheelchair drive system - the Alber e-motion M25: a several thousand euro assistive device that treats mobility like a SaaS subscription. Through Android app reverse engineering, proprietary Bluetooth protocol analysis, hours of staring at hex dumps (instead of the void), and good old-fashioned packet sniffing, we'll expose how manufacturers artificially limit essential features and monetize basic human mobility.

What you'll learn:

- how a 22-character QR code sticker, labeled as "Cyber Security Key", becomes AES encryption
- why your 6000€ wheelchair drive includes an app with Google Play Billing integration for features the hardware already supports
- the internals, possibilities and features of electronics worth 30€ cosplaying as a 595€ medical device
- the technical implementation of the "pay 99.99€ or stay slow" speed limiter (6 km/h vs 8.5 km/h)
- how nearly 2000€ in hardware and app features can be replaced by a few hundred lines of Python
- why the 8000€ even more premium (self-driving) variant is literally identical hardware with a different Boolean flag and firmware plus another (pricier) remote

We'll cover the complete methodology: from initial reconnaissance, sniffing and decrypting packets to reverse-engineer the proprietary communication protocol, to PoCs of Python replacements, tools, techniques, and ethical considerations of reverse engineering medical devices.

This is a story about artificial scarcity, exploitative DRM, ethics and industry power, and how hacker-minded creatures should react and act to this.

This talk will be simultaneously interpretated into German sign language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache aka. DGS).

        <abstract>What power structures are inherent to the field of computer-generated art? In the year 1965, so 60 years ago, the first three exhibitions of art created with the help of computers took place - in part independently of each other. We want to present the interesting aspects of developments since then and discuss them with Frieder Nake, one of the people who exhibited in those very beginnings and followed those developments with a critical attitude.</abstract>
        <description>We want to look at the complex topic of art created with computers, beginning with some careful and barely noticed first experiments and emerging into an ever more diverse and creative field, from different angles. In particular, we want to focus on the dynamics of power and how these developments were influenced by their context - from social movements to political pressure.

We want to start with explaining how the initial developments, both from an artistic - concrete art - and technological - the evolution of computers and the creation of the drawing machine Zuse Z64 in Germany and film techniques in the US, respectively - took place. We will do so in the context of the first three exhibitions that all took place in the year 1965. Their artworks were created by Georg Nees in Stuttgart, A. Michael Noll with Béla Julesz in New York and Frieder Nake with Georg Nees, again in Stuttgart.

In the following, we will try to give an outline of further developments. We provide examples how hierachies in art and science have developed and played a role in different events. In the domain of computer-generated art, similar to other art, there are two large influences hidden for the typical recipent of this art - galleries and critics. We will discuss this exemplary with early exhibitions of Frieder Nake being described by the FAZ and later on, how the east-west conflict has influenced the art and its exhibitions. Among other issues, we discuss patriarchal structures, the commercial side of art, how old tech is sold as revolutionary and how progress is still as connected with threatening feelings as in the early years.

Looking back at the beginnings, it is interesting to observe how artists - also with an artistic, rather than technical background - worked with the limitations and overcame them. Fortunately, the technological entry barrier to create algorithmic art yourself has drastically decreased over time and we want to encourage you to experiment yourself!

Frieder Nake is creating algorithmic drawings and doing visual research since 1964. In 1971, he published the influential essay "there should be no computer art" and he has been teaching computer graphics at the University of Bremen for decades. Enna Gerhard is pursuing a PhD in theory of computer science and creates algorithmic drawings in the meantime.

        <abstract>This talk reveals our in-depth vulnerability research on the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and its implications for BitLocker, Windows’ cornerstone for data protection. We will walk through the research methodology, uncover new 0-day vulnerabilities, and showcase full-chain exploitations that enabled us to bypass BitLocker and extract all the protected data in several different ways. This talk goes beyond theory - as each vulnerability will be accompanied by a demo video showcasing the complete exploitation chain. To conclude the talk, we will share Microsoft’s key takeaways from this research and outline our approach to hardening WinRE and BitLocker.</abstract>
        <description>In Windows, the cornerstone of data protection is BitLocker, a Full Volume Encryption technology designed to secure sensitive data on disk. This ensures that even if an adversary gains physical access to the device, the data remains secure and inaccessible.

One of the most critical aspects of any data protection feature is its ability to support recovery operations in case of failure. To enable BitLocker recovery, significant design changes were implemented in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This led us to a pivotal question: did these changes introduce any new attack surfaces impacting BitLocker?

In this talk, we will share our journey of researching a fascinating and mysterious component: WinRE. Our exploration begins with an overview of the WinRE architecture, followed by a retrospective analysis of the attack surfaces exposed with the introduction of BitLocker. We will then discuss our methodology for effectively researching and exploiting these exposed attack surfaces. Our presentation will reveal how we identified multiple 0-day vulnerabilities and developed fully functional exploits, enabling us to bypass BitLocker and extract all protected data in several different ways.

Notably, the findings described reside entirely in the software stack, not requiring intrusive hardware attacks to be exploited.

Finally, we will share the insights Microsoft gained from this research and explain our approach to hardening and further securing WinRE, which in turn strengthens BitLocker.

        <abstract>A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of bureaucracy. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into an unholy alliance to exorcise this spectre: The EU Commission, Member States, industry, even J.D. Vance. This threatens the digital rights and rules built up in the last decade.</abstract>
        <description>The new EU Commission has an agenda. What started with the report of former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Europe's "competitiveness" has quickly turned into "getting rid of bureaucracy", then into "simplification", and finally open "deregulation". What this means is that a large number of European laws that were adopted in the last decade to ensure sustanabiliy, protect human rights along the whole supply chain, or to ensure our digital rights, are watered down, and core elements are scrapped.

In terms of the EU's digital rulebook, it has already started in May with the deletion of a core compliance element in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - the obligation to keep records of your processing activities. While it sounds harmless - all the other rights and obligations still appy - it means that companies have no clue anymore what personal data they process, for which purposes, and how.

A much larger revision has been proposed on 19th November 2025, with the "omnibus" legislation dubbed "Digital Simplification Package". This will affect rules on data protection, data governance, AI, obligations to report cybersecurity incidents, and protections against cookies and other tracking technologies. Furthermore, the EU's net neutrality rules are scheduled to be opened for reform in December by the so called Digital Networks Act.

In this talk we discuss what to expect from the new EU agenda, who is driving it and how to resists. Our goal is to leave you better informed and equipped to fight back against this deregulatory trend. This talk may contain hope.

        <title>The Eyes of Photon Science: Imaging, Simulation and the Quest to Make the Invisible Visible</title>

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Science advances by extending our senses beyond the limits of human perception, pushing the boundaries of what we can observe. In photon science, imaging detectors serve as the eyes of science, translating invisible processes into measurable and analysable data. Behind every image lies a deep understanding of how detectors see, respond and perform.&#13;
&#13;
At facilities like the European XFEL, the world's most powerful X-ray free-electron laser located in the Hamburg metropolitan area, imaging detectors capture ultrashort X-ray flashes at MHz frame rates and with high dynamic range.  Without these advanced detectors, even the brightest X-ray laser beam would remain invisible. They help to reveal what would otherwise stay hidden, such as the structure of biomolecules, the behaviour of novel materials, and matter under extreme conditions. But how do we know they will perform as expected? And how do we design systems capable of “seeing” the invisible?&#13;
&#13;
I will take a closer look how imaging technology in large-scale facilities is simulated and designed to make the invisible visible. From predicting detector performance to evaluating image quality, we look at how performance simulation helps scientists and engineers understand the “eyes” of modern science.</abstract>
        <description>X-ray imaging detectors have come a long way in the last 15 years, turning ideas that once seemed impossible into realities. Imaging detectors in photon science are more than just high-speed cameras. They are complex systems operating at the limits of what’s physically measurable. Understanding how they behave before, during, and after experiments is essential to advancing both the technology and the science it enables.

In this talk, I’ll take you inside the world of detector simulation and performance modelling. I’ll explore how tools like Monte Carlo simulations, sensor response models, and system-level performance evaluations are used to:

- Predict detector behaviour in extreme conditions (such as MHz X-ray bursts), and
- identify critical performance bottlenecks before production.

By linking imaging technology with simulation and modelling, we can better interpret experimental data and design the next generation of scientific cameras. Beyond the technical aspects, this talk reflects on the broader theme of how we “see” though technology, what it means to make the invisible visible, and how simulation changes not only how we build instruments, but also how we understand them.

        <abstract>Learn from our mistakes during the first iteration of Network Operations for Europe's largest furry convention, Eurofurence.&#13;
Dieses Jahr hat ein kleines Team aus dem Chaos, Furries und Chaos-Furries ein neues Netzwerk-OC gegründet, um die Eurofurence mit gutem premium 👌 Internetz auszustatten. Wir erzählen von unseren Erfahrungen und den sozialen sowie technischen Herausforderungen.</abstract>
        <description>Zum Zeitpunkt der 29. Eurofurence (also dieses Jahr) hatte das Event eine Größe erreicht, bei der typische Event-Locations unsere speziellen Anforderungen nicht mal eben so erfüllen konnten. Beispielsweise ist eine aufwändige Audio/Video-Produktion Teil der Eurofurence, welche ein IP-Netz mit hoher Bandbreite, niederiger Latenz, niedrigem Jitter, Multicast-Transport und präzise Zeitsynchronisierung benötigt. Deshalb wurde dieses Jahr das _Onsite Eurofurence Network Operation Center_ _(EFNOC)_ gegründet. Unsere Aufgabe sollte es sein, alle Anforderungen der anderen Teams kompetent zu erfüllen wovon wir euch in diesem Vortrag etwas aus dem Nähkästchen erzählen wollen.

Grob haben wir wärend der EF29 das Team etabliert und ein Netzwerk gebaut, welches für A/V-Produktion, Event-Koordination und Event-Management (z.B. Security, Ticketing) benutzt wurde. Unser persönliches Ziel war es außerdem, ein benutzbares WLAN-Netzwerk für alle Besuchenden über dies gesamte Event-Venue hinweg zu schaffen – also von Halle H bis zum Vorplatz.
Unsere Architektur bestand dafür aus einem simplen Layer2-Netzwerk mit VLAN-Unterteilung, welches von _Arista DCS-7050TX-72Q_ mit 40Gbit/s Optiken bereitgestellt wurde. Die Aristas haben außerdem ein PTP-Signal propagiert, welches von einer Meinberg Master-Clock gesteuert wurde. Zusätzlich war ein Linux-Server als Hypervisor für diverse Netzwerk-Services wie DNS, DHCP, Monitoring und Routing im Einsatz.
So zumindest der Plan, denn während des Events wurden wir mit der Realität und vielen „spaßigen“ Problemen konfrontiert.

Unser Talk wird sich unter anderem mit diesen technischen Problemen beschäftigen, allerdings den Fokus nicht nur auf die technische Darstellung legen. Stattdessen werden wir auch beleuchten, wie wir als Team menschlich untereinander und in der Kommunikation mit anderen Teams damit umgegangen sind.

        <abstract>OpenAutoLab, an open source machine, that is capable of processing contemporary color and black-and-white films for analogue photography, is being presented here. It made its first public appearance at 37C3 and was already seen there in action, but had no organized talk or proper presentation. Now it is better documented, waits to be built by more people and to be further developed by the community.&#13;
This talk is about motivation behind developing OpenAutoLab and about the technical decisions made during it. It is argued that any dedicated film photographer is able to get one built.</abstract>
        <description>The presentation starts with a short overview of analogue photography processes and motivation of some photographers to shoot film instead of using contemporary digital technology.
It covers ways to process the film starting from least involved, such as sending to specialized laboratory, and possible motivation to get a processing machine.
Existing film processors are described with their features and deal-breakers for an end-user in 2025.
Then the history of developing OpenAutoLab is given, together with important design decisions made during development and why alternative solutions were discarded.
In the end the process of building the machine (and sourcing the needed parts) is given with some motivation towards changing it to fit the needs of an individual photographer.

        <abstract>Das Klima-Update vom FragDenStaat Climate Helpdesk.</abstract>
        <description>Chatgpt hat (bald) mehr Nutzer*innen als Wikipedia, OpenAI will in Zukunft den Energieverbrauch von Indien haben und das notfalls auch mit fossilen Energien. Der Energiehunger der künstlichen Intelligenz und der globale Ressourcenhunger für Chips und Elektroautos scheint den Rest Hoffnung einer klimagerechten Welt aufzufressen.

Auch in Deutschland finden wir uns in den Wasserkämpfen wieder, während global längst Bewegungen gegen wasserhungrige Konzerne und Rechenzentren zusammenfließen. Auf der ganzen Welt, von Lateinamerika bis Portugal und Serbien wehren sich Menschen gegen den Abbau des weißen Goldes Lithium, das für Elektroautos und Chips benötigt wird. Zusammen mit Wäldern brennen auch die Kommentarspalten und die staatlichen Repressionen gegen Klimaaktivismus nehmen zu. Ich möchte einen Überblick geben zum Zustand unserer Erde und der Klimabewegung und was Hacker*innen für die Rettung des Planeten können und welche Tech-Milliardäre wir dafür bekämpfen müssen.

Ich bin Joschi (they/them) vom FragDenStaat Climate Helpdesk. Ich bringe 10 Jahre Erfahrung in der Klimabewegung und Expertise für verschiedene Themen rund um Nachhaltigkeit und Digitalisierung mit.

        <abstract>Reports of GNSS interference in the Baltic Sea have become almost routine — airplanes losing GPS, ships drifting off course, and timing systems failing. But what happens when a group of engineers decides to build a navigation system that simply *doesn’t care* about the jammer?&#13;
&#13;
Since 2017, we’ve been developing **R-Mode**, a terrestrial navigation system that uses existing radio beacons and maritime infrastructure to provide independent positioning — no satellites needed. In this talk, we’ll share our journey from an obscure research project that “nobody needs” to a system now seen as crucial for resilience and sovereignty. Expect technical insights, field stories from ships in the Baltic, and reflections on what it means when a civilian backup system suddenly attracts military interest.</abstract>
        <description>Since 2017, our team at DLR and partners across Europe have been working on an alternative to satellite navigation: **R-Mode**, a backup system based on terrestrial transmitters. Our main testbed spans the Baltic Sea — a region now infamous for GNSS jamming and spoofing.

We’ll start by showing what GNSS interference actually means in practice: aircraft losing navigation data, ships switching to manual control, and entire regions facing timing outages — such as the recent disruption of telecommunications in Gdańsk during Easter 2025.

Then we’ll take you behind the scenes of building R-Mode: designing signals that can coexist with legacy systems, installing transmitters along the coast, and testing shipborne receivers in rough conditions. We’ll share personal moments — like the first time we received a stable position fix in the middle of the Baltic.

Finally, we’ll talk about perception and politics: how a “research curiosity” became a critical infrastructure project, why ESA now wants to build a *satellite* backup (with the same vulnerabilities), and how it feels when your civilian open-source navigation system suddenly becomes strategically relevant.

        <abstract>Zur Überraschung Vieler sind Juristen Wissenschaftler, die nach wissenschaftlichen Maßstäben arbeiten sollten und ihre Schriftsätze und Urteile auch nach stringenten wissenschaftlichen Kriterien gestalten und untereinander diskutieren sollten. Doch nur in einigen Rechtsgebieten funktioniert dies.&#13;
&#13;
Wie jede Wissenschaft ist auch die Rechtswissenschaft nur so gut wie das ihr zugrundeliegende Quellenmaterial – in diesem Fall sind das meist Urteile. Empirische Untersuchungen über diese Daten sind nur möglich, wenn sie der Forschung auch zur Verfügung stehen. Doch wissenschaftliche Arbeit im juristischen Feld ist aktuell nicht wirklich möglich, da die wenigsten Urteile veröffentlicht werden, da sich die Gerichte meist vor der dadurch anfallenden Arbeit scheuen. Wir betrachten, warum dies Grundsätze der Rechtsstaatlichkeit infrage stellt und warum Player aus der Wirtschaft mehr über deutsche Rechtsprechung wissen, als unsere Gerichte – und wie sie das zu Geld machen.</abstract>
        <description>Es ist tatsächlich ein ernsthaftes und reales wissenschaftliches und gesellschaftliches Problem, wenn Urteile hinter den wurmstichigen Aktenschränken der Amtstuben weggeschlossen werden. Wir belegen das anhand einiger besonders hahnebüchener Zitate aus aktuellen und nicht mehr änderbaren Urteilen aus der Praxis.

Wir erarbeiten aktuell Strategien, wie man das Rechtssystem power-cyclen kann, um Urteile in ihrer Gesamtheit, und damit die faktisch gesprochene Rechtslage in Deutschland wieder zugänglich werden. Als positiver Nebeneffekt der Verfügbarkeit von Urteilen kann Zivilgesellschaft und die Politik auch selber souverän überprüfen, ob unsere Richter das Recht typischerweise auch wirklich im Sinne der Legislative anwenden – keiner kann es aktuell wissen, wie können nur hoffen ...

        <abstract>Wer heutzutage eine Wohnung sucht, kommt kaum noch darum herum, sich einen Account bei Immoscout24 &amp; Co. zu erstellen. Diese „Platform Real Estate“ sind eine besondere Art der „Walled Gardens“, die ihr Geschäftsmodell auf die sich immer weiter verschärfende Wohnungskrise ausgerichtet haben. Und das ist äußerst profitabel für die Besitzer dieser Strukturen der Daseinsvorsorge: Im September 2025 stieg Scout24 in den DAX auf und reiht sich damit in Unternehmen wie BMW, Rheinmetall und SAP ein.</abstract>
        <description>In unserem Vortrag zeigen wir, wie Immoscout &amp; Co. mit einem ausgeklügelten technischen System Monopolprofite generiert, die Mieten in die Höhe treibt und ein Vermieterparadies aufgebaut hat, das die Mieter:innen in den Wahnsinn treibt.

Wir bleiben aber nicht bei der Kritik stehen, sondern zeigen, wie durch die Vergesellschaftung von Plattformen der Daseinsvorsorge ein Werkzeug entstehen kann, das den Mittellosen auf dem Wohnungsmarkt hilft. Vermieter in ihre Schranken zu weisen und Markttransparenz für alle statt nur für die Besitzenden zu schaffen.

        <abstract>FreeBSD’s jail mechanism promises strong isolation—but how strong is it really?&#13;
In this talk, we explore what it takes to escape a compromised FreeBSD jail by auditing the kernel’s attack surface, identifying dozens of vulnerabilities across exposed subsystems, and developing practical proof-of-concept exploits. We’ll share our findings, demo some real escapes, and discuss what they reveal about the challenges of maintaining robust OS isolation.</abstract>
        <description>FreeBSD’s jail feature is one of the oldest and most mature OS-level isolation mechanisms in use today, powering hosting environments, container frameworks, and security sandboxes. But as with any large and evolving kernel feature, complexity breeds opportunity. This research asks a simple but critical question: If an attacker compromises root inside a FreeBSD jail, what does it take to break out?

To answer that, we conducted a large-scale audit of FreeBSD kernel code paths accessible from within a jail. We systematically examined privileged operations, capabilities, and interfaces that a jailed process can still reach, hunting for memory safety issues, race conditions, and logic flaws. The result: roughly 50 distinct issues uncovered across multiple kernel subsystems, ranging from buffer overflows and information leaks to unbounded allocations and reference counting errors—many of which could crash the system or provide vectors for privilege escalation beyond the jail.

We’ve developed proof-of-concept exploits and tools to demonstrate some of these vulnerabilities in action. We’ve responsibly disclosed our findings to the FreeBSD security team and are collaborating with them on fixes. Our goal isn’t to break FreeBSD, but to highlight the systemic difficulty of maintaining strict isolation in a large, mature codebase.

This talk will present our methodology, tooling, and selected demos of real jail escapes. We’ll close with observations about kernel isolation boundaries, lessons learned for other OS container systems, and a call to action for hardening FreeBSD’s jail subsystem against the next generation of threats.

        <abstract>Lager, Duldung, Bezahlkarte, Essensscheine – Criminalization, Radicalization, Reality for Many People in East Germany&#13;
This talk sheds light on how these terms shape everyday life. We dive into an existence marked by uncertainty, isolation, and psychological strain, both in anonymous big cities and rural areas of East Germany. We ask: What does “solidarity” really mean in this context?</abstract>
        <description>In this session, people share everyday experiences with a system that often systematically undermines human rights and dignity.
We don’t just talk about the obvious obstacles like the payment card or residency obligation, but also the invisible wounds: the constant fear of deportation, the psychological consequences of isolation, and the daily experience of hostility. We highlight the specific challenges of life in cramped camps on the outskirts of big cities, as well as the social control and visibility in rural communities.
However, this talk is not just about naming problems. At its core is the urgent question: What does true solidarity really look like? How can support go beyond symbolic politics and short-term aid offers? This session is an invitation to shift perspectives, listen, and collaboratively develop concrete approaches for a more humane policy and a more solidaric coexistence.

        <abstract>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) based on ARM TrustZone form the backbone &#13;
of modern Android devices' security architecture. The word "Trusted" in &#13;
this context means that **you**, as in "the owner of the device", don't &#13;
get to execute code in this execution environment. Even when you unlock &#13;
the bootloader and Magisk-root your device, only vendor-signed code will&#13;
 be accepted by the TEE. This unfortunate setup limits third-party &#13;
security research to the observation of input/output behavior and static&#13;
 manual reverse engineering of TEE components.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, we take you with us on our journey to regain power over &#13;
the highest privilege level on Xiaomi devices. Specifically, we are &#13;
targeting the Xiaomi Redmi 11s and will walk through the steps necessary&#13;
 to escalate our privileges from a rooted user space (N-EL0) to the &#13;
highest privilege level in the Secure World (S-EL3). We will revisit old&#13;
 friends like Trusted Application rollback attacks and GlobalPlatform's &#13;
design flaw, and introduce novel findings like the literal fiasco you &#13;
can achieve when you're introducing micro kernels without knowing what &#13;
you're doing. In detail, we will elaborate on the precise exploitation &#13;
steps taken and mitigations overcome at each stage of our exploit chain,&#13;
 and finally demo our exploits on stage.&#13;
&#13;
Regaining full control over our devices is the first step to deeply &#13;
understand popular TEE-protected use cases including, but not limited &#13;
to, mobile payment, mobile DRM solutions, and the mechanisms protecting your biometric &#13;
authentication data.</abstract>
        <description>We present novel insights into the current state of TEE security on 
Android focusing on two widespread issues: missing TA rollback 
protection and a type confusion bug arising from the GlobalPlatform TEE 
Internal Core API specification.
Our results demonstrate that these issues are so widespread that on most
devices, attackers with code execution at N-EL1 (kernel) have a buffet 
of n-days to choose from to achieve code execution at S-EL0 (TA).

Further, we demonstrate how these issues can be weaponized to fully 
compromise an Android device. We discuss how we exploit CVE-2023-32835, a
type confusion bug in the keyinstall TA, on a fully updated Xiaomi 
Redmi Note 11.
While the keyinstall TA shipped in the newest firmware version is not 
vulnerable anymore, the vulnerability remains triggerable due to missing
rollback protections.

To further demonstrate how powerful code execution as a TA is, we'll 
exploit a vulnerability in the BeanPod TEE (used on Xiaomi Mediatek 
SoCs), to achieve code execution at S-EL3. Full privilege escalations in
the TEE are rarely seen on stage, and we are targeting the BeanPod TEE 
which is based on the Fiasco micro kernel. This target has never been 
publicly exploited, to the best of our knowledge.

Our work empowers security researchers by demonstrating how to regain control over 
vendor-locked TEEs, enabling deeper analysis of critical security 
mechanisms like mobile payments, DRM, and biometric authentication.

        <abstract>The spyware attack targeting WhatsApp, disclosed in August as an in-the-wild exploit, garnered significant attention. By simply knowing a victim's phone number, an attacker could launch a remote, zero-interaction attack against the WhatsApp application on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Subsequent reports indicated that WhatsApp on Samsung devices was also targeted by similar exploits.&#13;
In this presentation, we will share our in-depth analysis of this attack, deconstructing the 0-click exploit chain built upon two core vulnerabilities: CVE-2025-55177 and CVE-2025-43300. We will demonstrate how attackers chained these vulnerabilities to remotely compromise WhatsApp and the underlying iOS system without any user interaction or awareness. Following our analysis, we successfully reproduced the exploit chain and constructed an effective PoC capable of simultaneously crashing the target application on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Finally, we will present our analysis of related vulnerabilities affecting Samsung devices (such as CVE-2025-21043) and share how this investigation led us to discover additional, previously unknown 0-day vulnerabilities.</abstract>
        <description>In August 2025, it attracted significant attention when Apple patched CVE-2025-43300, a vulnerability reportedly exploited in-the-wild to execute "extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals”. A week later, WhatsApp issued a security advisory, revealing the fix for a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-55177, which was also exploited in-the-wild. Strong evidence indicated that these two vulnerabilities were chained together, enabling attackers to deliver a malicious exploit via WhatsApp to steal data from a user's Apple device, all without any user interaction.

To deconstruct this critical and stealthy in-the-wild 0-click exploit chain, we will detail our findings in several parts:
1. WhatsApp 0-Click Attack Vector (CVE-2025-55177). We will describe the 0-click attack surface we identified within WhatsApp. We will detail the flaws in WhatsApp's message handling logic for "linked devices," which stemmed from insufficient validation, and demonstrate how an attacker could craft malicious protocol messages to trigger the vulnerable code path.
2. iOS Image Parsing Vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300). The initial exploit allows an attacker to force the target's WhatsApp to load arbitrary web content. We will then explain how the attacker leverages this by embedding a malicious DNG image within a webpage to trigger a vulnerability in the iOS image parsing library. We will analyze how the RawCamera framework handles the parsing of DNG images, and pinpoint the resulting OOB vulnerability.
3. Rebuilding the Chain: From Vulnerability to PoC. In addition, we will then walk through our process of chaining these two vulnerabilities, constructing a functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that can simultaneously crash the WhatsApp application on target iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

Beyond Apple: The Samsung Connection (CVE-2025-21043). Samsung's September security bulletin patched CVE-2025-21043, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in an image parsing library reported by the Meta and WhatsApp security teams. This vulnerability was also confirmed to be exploited in-the-wild. While an official WhatsApp exploit chain for Samsung devices has not been publicly detailed, we will disclose our findings on this related attack. Finally, we will share some unexpected findings from our investigation, including the discovery of several additional, previously undisclosed 0-day vulnerabilities.

        <abstract>This presentation examines artistic practices that engage with sociotechnical systems through tactical interventions. The talk proposes art as a form of infrastructural critique and counter-technology. It also introduces a forthcoming HackLab designed to foster collaborative development of open-source tools addressing digital authoritarianism, surveillance capitalism, propaganda infrastructures, and ideological warfare.</abstract>
        <description>In this talk, media artist and curator Helena Nikonole presents her work at the intersection of art, activism, and tactical technology — including interventions into surveillance systems, wearable mesh networks for off-grid communication, and AI-generated propaganda sabotage.

Featuring projects like Antiwar AI, the 868labs initiative, and the curatorial project Digital Resistance, the talk explores how art can do more than just comment on sociotechnical systems — it can interfere, infiltrate, and subvert them.

This is about prototypes as politics, networked interventions as civil disobedience, and media hacks as tools of strategic refusal. The talk asks: what happens when art stops decorating crisis and starts debugging it?

The talk will also introduce an upcoming HackLab initiative — a collaboration-in-progress that brings together artists, hackers, and activists to develop open-source tools for disruption, resilience, and collective agency — and invites potential collaborators to get involved.

        <abstract>Have you ever wondered how the chips and algorithms that made all those electronic music hits work? Us too!&#13;
&#13;
At The Usual Suspects we create open source emulations of famous music hardware, synthesizers and effect units. After releasing some emulations of devices around the Motorola 563xx DSP chip, we made further steps into reverse engineering custom silicon chips to achieve what no one has done before: a real low-level emulation of the JP-8000. This famous synthesizer featured a special "SuperSaw" oscillator algorithm, which defined an entire generation of electronic and trance music. The main obstacle was emulating the 4 custom DSP chips the device used, which ran software written with a completely undocumented instruction set. In this talk I will go through the story of how we overcame that obstacle, using a mixture of automated silicon reverse engineering, probing the chip with an Arduino, statistical analysis of the opcodes and fuzzing. Finally, I will talk about how we made the emulator run in real-time using JIT, and what we found by looking at the SuperSaw code.</abstract>
        <description>This talk is a sequel to my last year's talk "Proprietary silicon ICs and dubious marketing claims? Let's fight those with a microscope!", where I showed how I reverse engineered a pretty old device (1986) by looking at microscope silicon pics alone, with manual tracing and some custom tools. Back then I claimed that taking a look at a more modern device would be way more challenging, due to the increased complexity.

This time, in fact, I've reverse engineered a much modern chip: the custom Roland/Toshiba TC170C140 ESP chip (1995). Completing this task required a different approach, as doing it manually would have required too much time. We used a guided automated approach that combines clever microscopy with computer vision to automatically classify standard cells in the chip, saving us most of the manual work.
The biggest win though came from directly probing the chip: by exploiting test routines and sending random data to the chip we figured out how the internal registers worked, slowly giving us insights about the encoding of the chip ISA. By combining those two approaches we managed to create a bit-accurate emulator, that also is able to run in real-time using JIT.

In this talk I want to cover the following topics:
- What I learned since my previous talk by looking at more complicated chips
- Towards automating the silicon reverse engineering process
- How to find and exploit test modes to understand how stuff works
- How we tricked the chips into spilling its own secrets
- How the ESP chip works, compared to existing DSP chips
- How the SuperSaw oscillator turned out to work

        <abstract>Ein geschlossener Kreislauf aus Klang und Störung. Kein Instrument, kein Ursprung, nur das Rauschen, das sich selbst gebiert. Frequenzen kratzen an der Grenze zum Bewusstsein, Feedback wird zum Atem einer Maschine ohne Körper. Aus dem Dunkel des Signals erhebt sich ein sirrendes Mantra — chaotisch, unheilig, autark. Eine Beschwörung der Leere durch elektrische Selbstzerstörung.</abstract>
        <description>Die Hände bewegen sich langsam, beinahe priesterlich,
sie berühren das Pult wie ein Altar aus Spannung und Staub.
Rauschen füllt den Raum — nicht als Geräusch, sondern als Gegenwart.
Ein Chor aus toten Signalen erhebt sich, summt, flackert, wächst zu einer Welle,
die den Atem der Anwesenden verschluckt.

        <abstract>Die Bauindustrie versteht sich auf der ganzen Herstellungs- und Lieferkette gut in der Umweltzerstörung und in der Verdrängung von Menschen für den Profit. Aber auch im Niderschlagen von Protesten und Widerständen ist sie bereits geübt.&#13;
Vor bald 3 Jahren wurde in der Schweiz ein wertvoller Wald besetzt. Die Menschen stellten sich damit gegen die Rodung des Waldes für eine Bauschuttdeponie und den Abrisswahn, sowie der damit verbundenen Gentrifizierung in der angrenzenden Stadt.&#13;
&#13;
Die Waldbesetzung und deren Zielen fand in breiten Kreisen Sympathien. Auf diese Blossstellung von Staat und Kapital, mussten diese sofort ihre Autorität an sich reissen. Da das Strafgesetz jedoch nur bedingt brauchbar war dafür, wurden sie kreativ nutzten auf der einen Seite das klassistische Justizsystem und auf der anderen Seite höhlten sie demokratische Institutionen weiter aus.</abstract>

        <abstract>Anfang der 90er brennen in der Schweiz die Asylheime. Nicht Rostock oder Hoyerswerda, sondern auch Chur, Lotzwil und Konolfingen bei Bern. Das ist die oft vergessene Welle rechtsextremen Terrors mitten in der Schweiz.&#13;
Rechtsextreme Skinheadgruppen, später Blood &amp; Honour- und Hammerskins-Strukturen, traten offen auf, organisierten Konzerte, patrouillierten in Gruppen durch Städte und agierten äusserst brutal. Die staatliche Reaktion blieb lange verhalten – Bagatellisierung, Wegschauen, fehlende Ermittlungen. Antifaschistische Organisation und Selbstschutz wurden damit zur Notwendigkeit.&#13;
Parallel dazu entwickelte sich in Bern eine kraftvolle antirassistische Bewegung, die weit über Szenepolitik hinausging. Während rechts motivierte Gewalt zunahm und Asylgesetzverschärfungen politische Mehrheiten fanden, begann ein breiter gesellschaftlicher Widerstand, getragen von migrantischen Communities, Gewerkschaften und linken Gruppen. In dieser Zeit fanden grosse Demonstrationen für die Antirassismusstrafnorm statt – ein Gesetz, das damals hart umkämpft war und dessen Annahme erst durch massiven öffentlichen Druck möglich wurde. Gleichzeitig entstand eine breite Sans-Papiers-Bewegung: Platzbesetzungen, Kirchenasyle, Streiks, «Papierlose Restaurants» und lokale Netzwerke machten sichtbar, dass Tausende Menschen ohne geregelten Status in der Schweiz leben und arbeiten.&#13;
Die Kämpfe dieser Jahre zeigen deutlich, dass antifaschistische und antirassistische Arbeit nicht getrennt voneinander existierten: Sie waren eine gemeinsame Antwort auf rechte Gewalt, und staatliche Ignoranz.</abstract>

        <abstract>Die Antifa™ kann auf eine bewegte Geschichte zurückblicken - also machen wir das doch mal. Wir bringen ein kleines Best-Of der jüngeren Bewegungsgeschichte mit und zeigen Bilder von und Einblicke in Momente, an denen uns klar wurde: Antifa will win!</abstract>
        <description>Nach gut 100 Jahren antifaschistischer Arbeit ist es Zeit, die schönen und erfolgreichen Augenblicke zu feiern. Dieser Talk soll Mut machen, sich den faschistischen Kräften in den Weg zu stellen: Wo andere wegschauen und weitergehen, Platz zu nehmen. Gemeinsam solidarische Bündnisse gegen Rechts zu schmieden, wenn andere ausschließen und hetzen. Wo andere mauern, Seebrücken zu bauen. Wenn andere spalten, unteilbar zu bleiben. Und sich zu widersetzen, wenn andere mitmachen.  So lange, bis alle Städte Nazifrei sind und es auch kein ruhiges Hinterland mehr gibt. Alerta!

Es gibt frische Eindrücke von den [#widersetzen](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/widersetzen) Aktionen in Gießen, wo wir mit 15.000 Menschen die Gründung des AfD Jugendverbands blockiert haben!

Als Interventionistische Linke haben wir seit zwei Jahrzehnten Erfahrungen mit antifaschistischer Handarbeit gesammelt und freuen uns, davon zu erzählen. Außerdem haben wir unsere Broschüre "[Antifa Will Win! - Alles eine Frage der Organisierung](https://interventionistische-linke.org/antifa-will-win)" im Gepäck - für alle, die Lust (bekommen) haben, sich antifaschistisch zu organisieren.

Es trägt gecoverte und selbstgeschriebene Songs und Medleys von Punk über Hamburger Schule bis Schlager mit Gitarre und Gesang vor und verknüpft die Inhalte der Songs miteinander. Es entsteht ein Geflecht von Musik und Text, dass Aufbrüche in Abgründen aufzeigt und Hoffnung macht sich gegen die Faschisierung in der Gesellschaft zusammen zu schließen.</abstract>

But.
Listen to Punk music. Punk's hopeful. Punk is never pretending that things are great. But the message, the verve, the rythm and everything behind punk music is: Fuck this, fight back!

        <abstract>Einschiss ist DER Ausnahmekünstler zwischen den Stationen Paracelsus Bad und Rathaus Reinickendorf der U8. Gefangen im Körper eines Mannes mit Charaktermodell German_default_3_bearded.obj macht Einschiss Musik gegen die Dinge die nerven: Nazis, Arbeit und Consent Forms (und Arbeit). Dabei setzt er modernste Technologien ein, um einen Typen so klingen zu lassen, als wäre es ein Typ mit Backing Track. Für mehr Musiker:innen hat das Bier nicht gereicht. Sorry.</abstract>
        <description>Was kann man noch über Einschiss sagen, was nicht schon alle gesagt haben? Diese Einmannpunkband hat mehrere Hörer:innen erreicht, indem er ihnen Fußbilder versprochen hat. Dieser kluge PR-Schachzug hat eine bis heute treue Fanbase gezwungen, jede der beiden EPs zu klauen. Einschiss macht Musik für die einfach gestrickten Leute, die am Montagmorgen denken: Scheisse, gar keinen Bock auf Nazis.

Das Live Set ist eine Tour de Force durch die seltener gespielten C- und D-Seiten auf einer vielsaitigen Gitarre mit teils unterschiedlichen aber immer häufiger auch eingängigen Texten zum Mitgrölen und Heiratsanträge machen. Das gute ist: selbst wenn es schlecht wird, dauert es nur 30 minuten. Eine Bahnfahrt macht da länger schlechte Laune.

        <abstract>Das Konzept ist simpel: Wir singen zusammen. Im Angebot haben wir vier Kategorien: Politische Classics, Punkrock-Hymnen, Antifaschistische Jodler und Umverteilungs-Hits des Quartiersmanagements Grunewald in der ansprechenden Karaoke-Variante. Man muss nichts können. Mit charmanter Anleitung manövrieren wir uns zusammen durch kollektive Dissonanzen!</abstract>
        <description>Einfach mal gepflegt einen raushauen! Was gibt es besinnlicheres, als dreistimmig "Scheiß AFD" zu singen und danach mit einem herzhaften "Rabimmel, Rabammel Oi! Oi! Oi!" die Harmonien zu zerdeppen. Die Sektion Schalala der hedonistischen Internationale organisiert seit einem Jahr monatlich Sing-Kundgebungen in Berlin und singt auf der Straße und überall, wo es sonst noch so passt - wie eben auf dem 39C3. Songtexte bringen wir mit.

        <track/>
        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Most clubs and concerts have predefined light and visuals, and often they are generic and not synced to the beat of the music. &#13;
Today we will show you that it's actually possible to sync visual effects to the beat of live music recorded from the microphone, and it's pretty easy!&#13;
Aimed at beginners.</abstract>
        <description>We will teach people how to set up and use TouchDesigner to perform audio analysis and how to draw basic effects and light shows that respond to the beat of the input audio. 
If you want to follow along, please come with  TouchDesigner preinstalled (the free version is perfectly fine). Recommended on Windows or Mac, but with enough pain it can run under Wine as well.

        <description>Katja Ruge’s DJ sets are a seamless fusion of Italo, New Wave, Cosmic Sounds, 80s, Dark Disco, and Electro. With deep musical knowledge and an intuitive sense of the crowd, she effortlessly adapts to both club environments and more intimate settings. She has played at renowned venues such as Golden Pudel Club, Else Berlin, Südpol, U&amp;G, as well as various events, gallery openings, and private parties.

End of 2023, Katja launched the DJ &amp; live set series “Electric Lights – Women in Electronic Music” at Planetarium Hamburg. Her first guests included Helena Hauff and DJ MELL G. The event’s Berlin premiere at Zeiss-Großplanetarium was a double sell-out in February 2025, featuring a live performance by JakoJako.

        <description>From crackling Kraut and Disco records to hyper produced Techno tracks - dance music has come a long way in the last six decades, and was always strongly influenced by evolving technology.

Dance music’s history is a feedback system between culture and circuitry. Each new invention—from the disco subwoofer to today’s neural-driven mastering tools—reshapes sound itself. RSS Disco’s timeline approach celebrates this continuum: a story of machines learning to groove, and humans learning to listen differently through them.

We take you on a trip through music history in a two hour DJ-set. Starting with music from the early 1970s and closing with tracks produced in 2025. Have a dance with us and get a feeling for the changing sound aesthetics, style and fashion the over the decades.
Not a lot of time to cover the sheer endless amount of music and information, you say? You are right! This can only be a tiny extract, filtered through our perspective and taste.
We’ll focus on a selection that feels representative for its time - exciting, beautiful, obscure or interesting. And of course some dirty bangers. 
To make the set not only danceable but also offer hungry brains visual context, we provide a live timeline with info about the decade's musical developments, technical breakthroughs/curiosities and fun facts.

        <abstract>Als Part der ToxicFamily, die seit mittlerweile 25 Jahren Label, elektronisches Magazin, Veranstalter und einfach eine Institution in Frankfurt ist, fördert Steve, der übrigens einer der dienstältesten Residents des Tanzhaus West in Frankfurt ist, aktiv die Frankfurter Underground Clubszene und vor allem den Nachwuchs. Ob es ein Gig bei der Toxic Family Radio Show im lokalen FM Radio ist, ein CDJ Lehrgang oder einfach nur aufmunterte Worte während eines Sets - viele Frankfurter DJs haben eine Geschichte über Steve zu erzählen.&#13;
Wenn Steve House Musik spielt, sieht man oft DJ Kollegen mit gespitzen Ohren an der Bar stehen - oder auch mal mitten auf der Tanzfläche - weil das Barpersonal selbst auf der Theke tanzt.</abstract>
        <description>Als ein bescheidener, introvertierter und klaustrophobischer Misanthrop und Glatzenträger meidet Steve das Rampenlicht. Deswegen steht er in einem Nachtclub gern in der dunklen Ecke, verbarrikadiert hinter Technik.

Eigentlich war es sein großer Traum, als Teil des ostkasachstanischen Staatsballett mit einer neopostbarockmodernen Aufführung von Schwanensee um die Welt zu touren. Da er aber die erforderliche Mindestgröße für neopostbarockanische, ostkasachstanische Staatsballett-Tänzer unterschreitet, schwache Sprunggelenke hat und außerdem nie tanzt, wird dieser wohl nie in Erfüllung gehen.

Ausgebildet als Vodka-Vernichtungsexperte weiss er, dass die Bar das wichtigste Element eines Clubs ist. Er ist ausserdem seit seinem 22. Lebensjahr ein erfolgreicher Leser und kann seit kurzem 6 der 8 in seinem Namen enthaltenen Buchstaben aufmalen. Wenn man ihm Zeit lässt. Aber Autogramme geben muss er ja eh nicht.

Wie im Hitchhikers Guide empfohlen, den er übrigens auch fast ganz allein durchgelesen hat, hat er immer sein Schmuse-Handtuch dabei.

Achja … und er spielt einfach grandiose House-Musik.

        <abstract>Festnacht is a fixture in Hamburg’s music scene. Together with L.F.T., he has steered the Neoprimitive label and event series for nearly a decade, releasing a broad range of mostly experimental electronic music from artists like Rosaceae, Children of Leir, and Alobhe, and inviting names such as Skee Mask, Anthony Rother, Bloody Mary, and Interstellar Funk to the iconic Golden Pudel Club. His DJ sets span the spectrum of Detroit-rooted techno and electro - always unpredictable, shaped by the night’s energy, and known for his skill in slowly and subtly warming up a room.</abstract>

        <abstract>Afidissima and Alice, two millennial stereotypes sharing music tips as emotional currency. &#13;
&#13;
Gabby radio host Afidissima delivers genre-chaotic sets drenched in dubby vibes and oozing with groove. A relentless cratedigger with questionable priorities. &#13;
Alice unites musical moments and moods that refuse to be united. Seductive, whimsical, followed by familiar paths, so as not to upset the ear and inner balance. &#13;
&#13;
Mixed feelings becoming multiple emotions. Everything as usual – just enhanced momentum.</abstract>

        <type>live performance</type>
        <abstract>The Uncontrolled Manifold works with electronics and machines that possess autonomy and obstinacy. These machines are brought into interaction with each other, creating danceable polyrhythms and, at the same time, a fascinating shadow play, because the machines are mounted on an overhead projector and their interaction is projected. Analog oscillators generate self-organizing coordination dynamics and organic patterns, while motors strike rubber strings producing deep, resonant bass sounds reminiscent of shamanic drumming. Supported by the visuals spectators may feel like being dragged into the vortex of a living clock, compelled to join the performance through movement and dance.</abstract>

“Dj Sloush aka Spitz + Zarrt aka Fellmaus will make you happy. There’s gonna be&#13;
these sounds coming from the speakers, new otherworldly ones mixed with&#13;
seemingly familiar yet undiscovered natural feeling waves of moods, or maybe hot&#13;
and twirling rapid fire bass jumping trippin balls ones.&#13;
Either way they’ll provide you with a guaranteed enjoyment of the infinite kind.”</abstract>

        <abstract>Babooshka is Marian Bodenstein, &#13;
who played with several punk bands such as LASSIE, LAFFF BOX, NICK NORMAL&#13;
and DBR at the moment. Under the moniker FUZZZGUN Marian is working as a graphic designer for bands, labels and other "multinational corporations". &#13;
Normally Babooshka would serve you a high octane dance set rooted in 70s power pop, punk and rocknroll but for the CCCChillfloor you’ll get a certain mixture of their favorite relaxin, beautiful and tearjerking  tracks, combined with some broken records to serve as analog loops and audioplay records. Babooshka is happy to play records that are normally reserved for the end of an emotional night of dance and shenanigans or even never would see the lights of the dance floor under „normal“ circumstances.</abstract>

        <description>Hygiene Training according to § 43 IfSG (German Infection Protection Act)

We are again conducting hygiene training sessions — the "Meatball Diploma", as it's called in German slang — for everyone involved in food preparation for others.

The goal is to raise awareness of a hygienic environment surrounding the preparation and serving of food at 39C3 and, consequently, to contribute to a higher level of healthiness of us all.


Ideally, this training is preceeded initially by an instruction by the relevant public health department (Gesundheitsamt). Even better, of course, is if you have already attended "follow-up training", for example, at 38C3 or CCCCamp.

If you have any relevant documents, please bring them along so we can update, stamp, and sign your proof of training. :-)

Of course, we also welcome everyone who is joining us for the first time without prior training from the public health department and/or without any prior knowledge of food hygiene at all.


We look forward to seeing you! - Be excellent to each other :-)

Team C3GELB (DECT 4352)

        <description>This workshop is for all who do not know at all or only have a vague idea what an “IP address” is. We’ll learn how the Internet works by making Internet traffic visible. This is a beginner’s workshop. If you toyed with Wireshark before, you will be bored to hell in this workshop.

Invisible to the casual user, lots of computers communicate and work together to deliver the kitten videos you’re craving. In this workshop, we use the tool Wireshark (available for all operating systems) to make this communication visible. In lots of life demos, we’ll learn that the domain names we’re familiar with, like ccc.de or fridaysforfuture.de, are a thin layer around IP addresses, which are the real addresses computers use to identify themselves. We’ll uncover which hidden information your browser sends along each request, and we’ll see how easy it is to intercept traffic.

This workshop is for everybody who is interested in knowing how the Internet works, in which form computers talk to each other. Absolutely no prerequisites are required. People who are familiar with network stacks will be bored to hell.

Note to the infrastructure team: In the final part of the talk, we’ll perform a standard ARP spoofing attack to intercept traffic from a volunteer and display their website login password on the projector. Of course we won’t use the congress network for this. I’ll use an hotspot of my own.

        <description>Die Rote Hilfe hat, wie viele weitere linke Organisationen in den letzten Wochen auch, ihre Konten verloren. Politische Entscheidung der Trump-Administration führten dazu. Über das SWIFT-System kann die USA auch hierzulande bestimmen, wer ein Konto erhält, wer nicht und wessen Bankverbindung einseitig gekündigt werden muss. 
.
Wir geben einen Überblick was warum bisher passiert ist, was die Folgen für uns sind, wie wir reagiert haben, wie es weiter geht und was IHR jetzt tun könnt.

        <description>Based on last year's session "How to thrive in Chaos", Part II will be about the topics, data and open questions we did not discuss last time. (https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/hub/de/event/how-to-thrive-in-chaos-discussion-round-about-chal/)


**Last year's announcement text:**

ADHD is becoming increasingly visible in society and research, with many individuals receiving late diagnoses, especially women with ADHD. While there has been progress at universities, including the formation of student groups for neurodiverse individuals, there remains a lack of visibility for neurodiverse researchers. This discussion round aims to provide a safe space for everyone - whether they have an ADHD diagnosis or not - to discuss the challenges and benefits of working as a neurodiverse researcher. You are welcome to share your experiences and strategies to manage the chaos, but no one will be forced to.

Moderation: Sarah, who received her ADHD diagnosis in 2023, works as a data scientist since May 2024. She will share her experiences and strategies as a woman in science with ADHD, in order to increase the awareness and provide (hopefully) helpful insights.

Target audience:
- Neurodiverse individuals (with or without a diagnosis)
- Researchers collaborating with neurodiverse colleagues
- Anyone interested in learning about the needs and challenges of individuals diagnosed with ADHD

Other neurodiverse individuals are also warmly invited to join the discussion and share their knowledge. However, due to Sarah's own diagnosis, she will primarily address ADHD related topics, as she can only talk about her own experiences

        <description>A session on prefiguration.

As a term. 
As a concept. 
As a theory.
As a practice.
As an attitude. 
As an emotional mode of life.
As a method.

I will tell you about my current activist-research activities and then we can get into discussions about it.

What does prefiguration mean? A few approaches:

...'a transformative political instrument, [...]  [which] aims to establish social relationships, practices and institutions in the here and now that are intended to represent a glimpse of the desired society – among other things, in order to generate motivational effects through exemplarity and to test and practise post-transformative subjectivity." (Sörensen 2023, p. 14), from Sörensen, P. (2023). Prefiguration: On the political nature of transformative practice. Campus.

...“the deliberative experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now” (Raekstad &amp; Gradin 2020, p. 10), from Raekstad, P. &amp; Gradin, S. (2020). Prefigurative Politics: Building Tomorrow Today. Polity Press.

...‘the concept of prefigurations simply refers to the search for ways of anticipating an egalitarian, horizontal society [...] a shared existence in solidarity with living beings without mutual oppression and exploitation’ (Starodub 2025, p. 8), from Starodub, A. (2025). Future Without Borders: History of Ideas and the Present State of Border Demarcation. edition assemblage.

...'anarchist organizations generally prefigured the future anarchist society in two ways. First, by embodying the kinds of organizational structure and methods of deliberation and decision-making that a future society would contain. Second, by performing the kinds of functions that organizations in a future society will carry out. [...] which was not original or exclusive to the anarchist movement.' (Baker 2023, S. 122-123), aus Baker, Z. (2023). Means and Ends: The Revolutionary Practice of Anarchism in Europe and The United States. ak press.

        <description>For two years now, children in the public education system of the russian federation are subjected to an unthinkable scale of militaristic indoctrination. Every child takes part in around 70 war-related holidays per year. The more talented ones are involved into propaganda activities to such degree that they have practically no time to study.

In this SoS we won't like just to point out that millions of children are being militarized at an unthinkable scale. We also would like to speculate a bit on how and why it is possible that many of you still probably do not know about it.

To draw attention to the above-mentioned topic, there will be also a video installation parallel take place at the monument "Kriegsklotz” not so far from the CCCH ( https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=53.559128&amp;mlon=9.989267&amp;zoom=18 ). The installation will be available during 39C3 every night between 16:00 and 00:00. We recommend taking a look at this installation too.

        <description>The film "Of People Who Climb Trees" showcases how activists in Southern Germany and beyond carry out sometimes spectacular protest actions. The focus is on climate justice, as well as the consumption of resources and land.

Everyone is welcome—whether you want to gain insight into the world of forest occupations, become more active, or are simply curious.

Afterwards, an open discussion with climate activists will take place.

English subtitles are available.

        <description>Warum fällt es uns schwer, konzentriert zu bleiben – und wie lässt sich Aufmerksamkeit gezielt trainieren?

In diesem zweiten Teil geht es um die neurobiologischen Grundlagen von Fokus, Aufmerksamkeit und Lernen. Du erfährst, wie dein Gehirn Informationen auswählt, speichert und langfristig verfügbar macht – und warum Ablenkung, Multitasking und Reizüberflutung diese Prozesse messbar beeinträchtigen.

Zusätzlich erhältst du konkrete, wissenschaftlich fundierte Werkzeuge zur Verbesserung von Konzentration, Lernfähigkeit und mentaler Klarheit im Alltag.

Kann das funktionieren? Wie gehts den Kindern nach der Schulzeit und was heißt das für Eltern?

Ich bin Schulgründer einer Demokratischen Schule und präsentiere euch anschaulich mit vielen Grafiken, Videos und ein paar Studien, wie das bei uns so läuft. Im Anschluss könnt ihr mir und einem Elternteil eines Schülers Fragen stellen.

        <description>In diesem Workshop lernst du die Grundlagen der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation (GFK) nach Marshall Rosenberg kennen. Du erfährst, wie du deine eigenen Bedürfnisse klar ausdrückst, die Bedürfnisse anderer verstehst und Konflikte konstruktiv lösen kannst.

Mit praxisnahen Übungen und Werkzeugen trainierst du, empathisch zuzuhören, Missverständnisse zu vermeiden und Beziehungen – beruflich wie privat – nachhaltig zu verbessern.

        <description>We live in times of intense conflicts and their violent escalation. One of the central theses of Jalka's work is that a viable democracy and a conscious culture of constructive conflict resolution go hand in hand.

Cultivating this ability requires a conscious decision to engage with individual, collective and societal patterns of dispute behaviour and conflict management. Starting with oneself, as well as in our interactions with others, in public discourse and in our behaviour towards others. With a willingness to change something in order to reduce, and in the best case even prevent, the suffering and violence that can potentially arise from conflicts. And to learn from this for the future.

What exactly will this SOS session be about?

We will engage in a number of exercises and discussion rounds based on the following questions:

How do you deal with conflicts? How do others deal with conflicts? How do you experience conflicts? What exactly are conflicts? What dynamics promote conflicts? What patterns are there in place? How can we deal with conflicts constructively? How do conflicts caused by individual, interpersonal and structural factors differ? And: How can conflict management be designed to be sensitive to discrimination?

I will share with you my experiences from my work as a mediator and from past workshops I have held on this topic. In addition to exercises, I will also bring along some literature for further reading.

Please feel free to bring your own questions and insights to the session so that we can all learn from and with each other. I look forward to seeing you.

        <description>While medical institutions struggle to fill trans people's needs for a medical transition, an increasing number of trans people resort to managing their hormonal transition on their own. Alongside this, the DIY community has amassed a large amount of both theoretical and applied medical knowledge, matching and sometimes even surpassing researchers in the field.

In this talk, I will point out what's right and wrong with institutionalized trans research, give insights into the DIY communities' pragmatic approach to community healthcare and show what we're doing to turn lay expertise and even anecdotes into evidence-based medical research -- all without a doctor involved. "all creatures welcome" -- all necessary science-prerequisites are included along the way.

---

If you enjoyed this talk (or not), or if you missed it (or not) -- I will do a speedrun attempt of presenting the same material in under 4.5 minutes on Day 4:

        <description>Event NOT in english language - sorry.

This is no "how to get rich fast" talk.

This Talk is about the HOW of efficiently handling money.
I want to give you the means to decide yourself, what risks to take and what investments to make.

Most of my Information is from my Economic Computer Sciences Bachelors degree (mainly the economics part)
Topics will be: How to calculate investments, how to calculate (expected) interest and compound interest, how to "sort" your debt to efficiently pay it off.

After my nerdy maths lecture, there will be time for questions and topics you are interested in. (Still under SoS Rule: No commercial advertising or crypto shilling)

I did a similar SoS last year, this year will even be with slides.

        <description>Jujutsu (jj) is a new version control system that uses Git as its backend. Since trying it last year, it has completely replaced Git for me. It manages to be less complex than Git, while giving you more control. I think you'll like it too!

Lately, when people ask me complex Git questions, my answer is often: "First, install jj…" And that's only half a joke. :P

---

A few things I like about Jujutsu: There's no index, but instead you get a subcommand for splitting changes. Commits have stable IDs that stay the same even after rewriting. Anonymous branches! Conflicts are first-class objects and don’t have to be resolved immediately during a rebase. Rewriting history is very easy.

And because it's Git-compatible, you can use Jujutsu right away in existing projects without anyone else noticing. :3

I'm planning to do this session in two parts: First, an introductory talk about jj. After that, a "workshop" part where you can install Jujutsu and try it for yourself!

        <description>Du bist auf dem Congress und hast plötzlich das Gefühl, eigentlich viel zu wenig Plan von all den Themen hier zu haben um hier zu sein? Du hast manchmal keinen Plan wovon die Leute eigentlich reden? Du bist nicht unbedingt wegen den IT-Themen hier, sondern vor allem wegen all dem anderen, was hier sonst noch so passiert?

Wenn du irgendeine der Fragen mit ja beantworten kannst, bist du bei dieser Session genau richtig. Nicht großartig moderiert, einfach eine nette Kennenlernveranstaltung.

        <description>KinkyGeeks and RopeLabs join forces to host a Beginner Bondage Workshop.

Instructors [@DoodleMe](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/DoodleMe) and [@KnottyLola](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/KnottyLola) will guide you through the foundations of Japanese rope bondage, also known as Shibari.

You will learn core safety concepts, basic theory, and a small set of beginner-friendly knots. These are practical ties you can use at home and that form the base for more complex work later.

This is a peer-based workshop aimed at complete beginners. No prior experience is needed. Singles, pairs, and small groups are all welcome.

The workshop runs in lab mode. There is no sexual content and everyone remains fully clothed. The space is 18+ only.

Please bring your own non-stretch rope if you have it. Practice rope will be available. Bring a blanket or cushion to sit on the floor comfortably. There is no dress code, but fitted clothing makes tying easier than loose layers.

The workshop will be taught in English.

Places are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person. Get your free ticket here: [https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/101-1/](https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de/kinkygeeks/101-1/)

        <description>Klimagerechtigkeitsaktivismus: ein Blick hinter die Kulissen.

In Augsburg und Ravensburg gibt es seit 2019 Nerdgruppen, die nicht nur starke Meinungen zu Programmiersprachendesign haben :-), sondern auch mit zivilem Ungehorsam versuchen, einen Beitrag für Klimagerechtigkeit zu leisten. Im Laufe der Zeit haben wir verschiedene Techniken erlernt und weiterentwickelt, die größtenteils auf beliebige andere Städte übertragbar sind.

Aktivismus wirkt leider meist verzögert, indirekt oder schwer quantifizierbar. In dieser Session möchten wir einen ganz bestimmtes Projekt vorstellen, bei dem sich ausnahmsweise der Erfolg doch unmittelbar und direkt eingestellt hat:

Der erfolgreichen Rettung des rodungsbedrohten Forst Kasten bei München.

In Zeiten des Rechtsrucks freut sich vielleicht die eine oder andere Person hier über etwas Positives :-)

        <description>Ähnlich wie in den letzten Jahren wollen wir uns auch dieses Jahr wieder treffen und uns rund um das Thema Verwaltungsdigitalisierung austauschen und vernetzen.

Was ist der Faxgeräteclub und warum machen wir das?

Wenn wir über Behörden-IT sprechen, dann sprechen wir oft über einen zwingend notwendigen Wissensaufbau und die Internalisierung von IT-Kompetenz in der öffentlichen Verwaltung. Aber wer sich dann tatsächlich für einen Job in der Verwaltung entscheidet oder aus der Zivilgesellschaft heraus positiv auf die Verwaltung einwirken will, die:der braucht viel Überzeugungstalent und oft auch Durchhaltevermögen. Aber wir können auch viel Positives bewirken.

Woran scheitert es in der Praxis, wo liegen die strukturellen Probleme und welche Impulse braucht es jetzt aus der Politik?

Wir sprechen im Faxgeräteclub über unsere Erfahrungen im Alltag in und mit Behörden, darüber, was in der Verwaltung alles noch falsch läuft und wie wir gemeinsam etwas daran ändern können. Kommt vorbei uns lasst uns gemeinsam in lockerer Runde ein wenig diskutieren und Pläne schmieden! Willkommen sind alle, die sich für die IT der öffentlichen Verwaltung interessieren und/oder gerne mit uns ihre Ideen oder Fragen teilen möchten.

        <description>The year is 2040. Everyday digital life is convenient, but the digital sovereignty of state and civil society remains a sensitive issue. Recent approaches to authentication based on behavior, physical characteristics, or DNA are intended to make many things even easier – but do we want that, and if so, how? In our workshop, you will be part of a citizens' assembly deciding on the applications, implementation, and limits of these technologies. Join us in discussing the focus for tomorrow's biometrics! (This workshop will be held in German.)

        <description>Ethical non-monogamy, whether its polyamory, relationship-anarchy, open relationships, solo-poly and so on are on the rise.
But understanding, what these new approaches to relationships are all about sometimes seems a little difficult because of all the lingo we use to make our conversations easier. This session gives a little look into the meaning of strange terms like polycule, compersion or metamour, easily misunderstood ideas like garden party enm vs. kitchen table enm, or acronyms like NRE. Armed with these (new?) concepts we'll also have a little Q&amp;A where we'll try to give some insights into the realities of ENM life.

        <description>Like last year we jam (playing spontaneous/improvised music for ourselves) together in small groups. In order to avoid a high noise level in the room we are going to use Headphones. We welcome every kind of Instrument from your laptop with a midi-controller, your E-Guitar, a Microphone to your modular synthesizer. If you want to participate please read the following carefully.

Please bring the following with you if you plan to participate: (if you don't bring the stuff you may be able to borrow it)
- Headphones
- Extension Chord/Power Strip if your stuff needs power
- Cable to send your tones to the other people. Small audio jack is the prefered method. Adapters are nice.

If you can, it is nice to bring Instruments for other people so people can participate without knowing about the jam before congress. It is probably a good Idea to write your name/a unique identifier on your stuff to avoid confusion.

I have designed a PCB that lets 5 People plug in their instruments and headphones via small audio jack. Only the Headphone volume can be adjusted on the board. Unfortunately the board is still in the mail and I don't know if it works at all. For this reason it would be nice if you could bring Equipment to route peoples audio signals to Headphones. Especially Mixers Multi-Headphone-Amplifiers and Cables to connect everything together would be appreciated.

Matrix Room for Coordination:

I'm excited to see all of you :)

        <description>Queer People in Occupied Territories: Cases from Kherson

This talk is about the experiences of queer people living in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, with a focus on Kherson.

Using real-life cases, it shows how war, occupation, and strict control affect LGBTQ+ people’s daily lives — their safety, visibility, ability to stay true to their identity, and to keep in touch with their community.

The talk will cover:

Risks and survival strategies under occupation, including hiding one’s identity, internal and external displacement, and self-censorship.

Violence and threats faced by LGBTQ+ people, from psychological pressure and blackmail to direct repression by the occupying authorities.

The talk will be held online.

        <description>How can we work together to improve political decision-making processes in the long term? What do you want from democracy?

Motivation:
While our democracy can be shaped by the people as they wish on paper, the population seems to be largely dissatisfied with political actions:
- The handling of many crises appears to be inadequate
- Urgent problems seem to be postponed
- Democratic participation seems tedious and ineffective

We would like to work together to find ways to improve, that can be implemented within the framework of our existing political system.

Procedure:
- 15 min. presentation on motivation and information
- 35 min. bug fixing - Moderated discussion round to jointly develop solutions

        <description>The system of harassing payment cards for people receiving asylum seeker benefits is not a new idea, but has been dusted off from the 1990s/2000s. But even back then, there was resistance – and it was anything but boring!
Revel in the old days with us and be inspired by past actions and successes!

We show pictures of the initiative against the chip card system in Berlin, which was active there mainly in the noughties against the precursors of today's payment cards.

        <description>_Introduction to Embedded Rust on Microcontrollers and the [Hakkaa workshop task](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/project/detail/assembly/hakkaa-board-smd-soldering-embedded-rust-for-begin/). This introduction is mostly aimed at participants with some experience in Rust._

For everyone who has already taken their first steps with Rust and can't wait to get knee-deep into using Rust on a Microcontroller. It aims to show you the little differences of this environment, presenting the workshop challenge and pointing you in the right direction for getting started.

For absolute beginners we recommend to attend [Rust programming language: An absolute beginner workshop with intro presentation](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/rust-programming-language-an-absolute-beginner-wor) first and then our [second round of this introduction on day three](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/einfuhrung-embedded-rust-fur-workshop-hakkaa-_mlyg).

This session starts with a presentation of about 30 minutes in English and a round of questions for all. After that, our team supports you with your first self-paced steps.

The initial part of the presentation covers using Rust on a microcontroller in general. The second part focuses on working with the Hakkaa board.

If you've got a question after this session, you can find us at the Hakkaatachi assembly or in [our Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#hakkaatachi-39c3:matrix.org).

We recommend:

* Having a soldered and tested [Hakkaa-Board](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-hardware) (whose kit you can get at the Hakkaatachi assembly)
* Your laptop set up with the [development tooling](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-firmware?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) so that you can spend more time on programming than on installing
* Your laptop fully charged

        <description>PASS, FAIL, or SEGFAULT?
I am curious how other people test their software, particularly C software.

Do you test at all?
How do you do it?
Do you have any hacks to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot?
Let's share your experiences!

To break the ice and get the conversation started, I will give a short talk about my journey through the testing jungle.
And then let's have an open discussion where you can talk about your testing approach. It would be awesome if you could show us a test you wrote.

Everyone is welcome, especially if you're just curious. No testing or C experience is necessary. This is a great place to ask questions and learn from the workflows of others.

You can contact me (Dominik) via email: 39C3@dominikloidolt.at

See you.

        <description>In diesem Workshop lernen wir, wie wir transdermale HET (Hormon Ersatz Therapie) Produkte für trans Personen einfach selber machen können.

Die beiden Möglichkeiten sind dabei Sprays und Gels, für beides sind genug Zutaten da.

Es gibt nur einen (rudimentären, scuffed) Setup dafür und es eignet sich nicht um in größerer Runde zu arbeiten. Wenn viele kommen gerne unabhängigen Austausch von Rezepten, Methoden, Vernetzen von trans Menschis oder Aktivistis. In den Folgetagen kann an der Asembly (Projekt31) auch noch gut gebraut werden
.

        <description>You probably have heard of "Venture Capital" - the mysterious infinite source of money that powers the startups of Sillicon Valley (and beyond), that powers the "AI revolution" and "crypto revolution." You even might have heard names like YCombinator and a16z, or terms like "Unicorn", "PMF" and "TAM".

But where does that money come from? How can you get it? And why do people continue to give money to startups, despite 90% of them returning 0 money?

Even among IT nerds, VC is often seen as something vague and mysterious - despite it shaping the world of technology since the early 2000s. Some people get money, some don't - with little rhyme or reason.

This is a small talk of someone who actively participated in the VC ecosystem. The primary goal isn't to bash or praise that industry (though it deserves a lot of bashing), but to shine a light on how it works under the hood.

Note: this is an adapted version of a short lecture I gave at the Mega-Knowledgecamp (Hacksaar 2025)

        <description>We all struggle with lots of passwords, often forgotten, reused or leaked. Passkeys promise to free us from both the hassle and the breaches. But will they solve authentication, or are they failed by design? A deep‑dive into convenience, control, and everything between.

Passkeys are designed to replace passwords. All you need is your phone or hardware token, meaning you have to remember only one password at most. But isn't that the promise of password managers? Although they fulfil a similar role, password managers usually use classic passwords, making them seem like an interim solution on the way to more secure authentication. Wouldn't it be great to get rid of passwords once and for all and switch to passkeys?

While passkeys promise a passwordless future, the reality is far more complex. User reluctance, questionable usability and corporate interests are making the case for passkeys increasingly difficult. So let's delve into whether passkeys do make sense from the perspective of both professional and regular users.

This talk is not a technical deep dive into passkeys, but rather addresses the issues of IT management &amp; IAM and whether secure "passwordless" auth can work in the real world. The aim is not to give a bureaucratic or opinionated talk, but to open a discussion about enshittification and whether auth (doesn't) work(s) for both regular and pro users.

        <description>Astrology is usually associated with horoscopes, prediction, or belief systems. In this self-organised session, we’ll test a different idea: using astrology as a symbolic language to reflect on daily routines, decision-making, and energy management — without fate, mysticism, or “the stars made me do it”.

The session is interactive and experimental. We’ll look at how astrological concepts can function similarly to tools people already use: retrospectives, calendars, personality models, or context-setting frameworks.

This is not about accuracy, belief, or convincing anyone. It is about usability:

Does this framing help reflection?

Where does it break down?

When does it become annoying or meaningless?

No astrology background required. Critical perspectives are explicitly invited.

        <description>When it comes to feminism, many men* who are generally in favor of it stay in the  background: They don't want to intrude, override any woman*'s voice, doubt that they have anything to say, think they know too little to participate in the discussion.
We think that feminism is ready for the next (r)evolutionary phase, in which men are not "allies" but see themselves as a subject of feminism. What do you think: Time for FeMENism?
In this session we want to collect male* voices (too), create room for conversations and understand how people of all genders view this topic. All creatures welcome!

        <description>Citizen science can mean many things: DIY measurements, community research, data activism, social experiments, artistic inquiry, or collective knowledge work. At CCC, many such projects exist — often without ever using the label “citizen science”.
This session follows a “show your pet” format. Participants are invited to bring and briefly present their own projects, tools, experiments, or unfinished ideas and share:
what the project does


who participates


how (or if) it serves a community


whether calling it “citizen science” helps or gets in the way


Projects do not need to be finished, funded, successful, or formally recognised. Critical, messy, and experimental work is explicitly welcome.
Alongside peer exchange, the session creates space to explore if and how collaboration with the wider citizen science community — including ECSA — could be useful:
What kinds of support would actually help these projects?


Where does institutional collaboration feel helpful — or harmful?


What would make collaboration worth the effort?


The goal is not recruitment or alignment, but to understand what collaboration should look like from the project side, if at all.

        <description>You use Nextcloud Collectives within a group or plan to do so? Come along and talk with the maintainers and other community members. With Collectives we aim to build a collaborative knowledge database for self-organized and activist groups. Currently we focus on fostering the community and reducing hierarchies between us, the developers and the direct users of Collectives.

        <description>Un espacio para reunir a la comunidad de habla hispana en el 39c3. La idea es presentarnos brevemente (¿de dónde vienes? ¿en qué andas?), platicar y hacer comunidad. El idioma principal será español pero el espacio es abierto y flexible. Sin formalidades ni láminas, solo personas.

A space to bring together the Spanish-speaking community at the 39c3.
The idea is to briefly introduce ourselves (where are you from? what are you working on?), chat, and build community. Spanish will be the main language but the space is open and flexible. No formalities or slides, just people.

Or do you not know this epic and complex sci-fi board game about diplomacy, politics, war and intrigue yet? Let us use this short time slot for a quick meeting to share our contacts to stay in touch. Possible advantages we are going to have are e.g.:

- New regional groups for (regular) games
- Sharing/Discussions about house rules
- Creation/Discussions of new maps

        <abstract>With Signal, Whatsapp, and other centralized messengers suddenly running their servers in an authoritarian territory, we need a decentralized alternative. Delta Chat apps work with most e-mail servers but chatmail servers are more secure, faster and easy to setup, and have become the primary choice for new users. Learn how to host chatmail, and help creating the resilient chatmail server network for a shattered world!</abstract>
        <description>You don't need expensive hardware to run a chatmail server - a cheap VPS or raspberry pi can support hundreds of users. All storage is temporary, as Delta Chat stores messages only on end devices. This makes chatmail tremendously easy to get started with - bring your child and learn together.

To setup a chatmail server, you need:
- SSH root access to a server, with a public IP address, and a domain (we will bring some for the workshop)
- basic command line knowledge

So come as you are, and join this chat group to get started: https://i.delta.chat/#AB68F428FCEF88D32B46189314FDBB18B2789654&amp;a=groupedit%40nine.testrun.org&amp;g=39c3%20chatmail%20relay%20workshop&amp;x=zIwlF9uvvoxzDLo2GBFRRm2l&amp;i=vcZd2RULjs39Vl-Fs2L-ZfIT&amp;s=oUmgp0IBDyBnI7dTslH3CK37

        <description>Sobald du denkst, irgendwer sollte etwas tun, bist du irgendwer. Egal, worum's geht. Einige Freund*innen bewegen sich und ihre Beziehungen durch autonome Zonen, Pläne, Besetzungen, Wälder und Träume. Sie versuchen etwas aufzubauen, irgendwo anzufangen, das richtige Ziel zu finden und vor lauter Klimakollaps und drohendem Faschismus die eigenen Werte nicht zu verlieren. At the same time, it’s about the thrill of yet another journey, revolt, camp, action und das Scheitern auf dem Weg hinter die Kiefermonokulturen. Wann? Jetzt. Immer jetzt.

        <abstract>In dieser Live-Session wird gescannt, gesampelt und gesendet: medizinischer Ultraschall im Megahertz-Bereich trifft digitale Audioverarbeitung mit 48 Kilohertz. Ultraschall.fm dient als Interface zwischen Körper und Codec – vom Schallkopf bis zum Kopfhörer, von Wellen im menschlichen Gewebe zu (Radio-) Wellen im Äther. Radiomegahertz demonstriert die open source Podcasting-Software zur Produktion einer medizinischen Live-Ultraschall Untersuchung. Die Session ist für alle Podcast-Kreaturen, die den Megahertz-Bereich auch hören und nicht nur sehen möchten.&#13;
&#13;
This live session involves scanning, sampling, and broadcasting: medical ultrasound in the megahertz range meets digital audio processing at 48 kilohertz.Ultraschall.fm serves as an interface between the body and the codec—from the transducer to the headphones, from waves in tissue to waves in the ether. Radiomegahertz demonstrates the open source podcasting software. The session is for all creatures who want to hear the megahertz range and not just see it.</abstract>
        <description>Wenn Neo in die Matrix schaut, sieht er die Welt. Ärzt:innen sollten bei der Betrachtung eines Ultraschallbildes mit den typischen Graustufen die Anatomie des Menschen erkennen. Doch die Entstehung und Interpretation des Graustufenbildes liegt in der Hand der Ultraschallenden. Neo muss genauso wie Ärzt:innen lernen, die Technik zu nutzen und die Bilder zu interpretieren. Radiomegahertz erstellt Podcasts über Ultraschall in der Medizin und wird während der Live-Session auf die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen von Ultraschall eingehen.
Zur Verdeutlichung werden Freiwillige live „geschallt” (sonografiert). Das Ziel ist die Erstellung eines Podcasts bzw. Videopodcasts. Zur Produktion wird die Open-Source-Software Ultraschall.fm verwendet. Die Software-Entwickler von Ultraschall.fm sind während der Session vor Ort und bieten Support bei podcasttypischen Fragen.

When Neo looks into the Matrix, he sees the world. When looking at an ultrasound image with the typical gray scale, doctors should be able to recognize human anatomy. However, the creation and interpretation of the gray scale image is in the hands of the ultrasound technician. Just like doctors, Neo must learn to use the technology and interpret the images. Radiomegahertz creates podcasts about ultrasound in medicine and will discuss the possibilities and limitations of ultrasound during the live session. To illustrate this, volunteers will be “scanned” (sonographed) live. The goal is to create a podcast or video podcast. The open-source software Ultraschall.fm will be used for production. The software developers from Ultraschall.fm will be on site during the session to offer support with podcast-related questions.

        <abstract>Spätestens seitdem Donald Trump wieder im Weißen Haus sitzt, geistert die „Digitale Souveränität“ verstärkt durch die politischen Diskussionen. Wir haben mittlerweile ein Zentrum dafür (ZenDiS) und einen Fonds, der sich zur Agentur gemausert hat (Sovereign Tech Fund/Agency). Aber ist jetzt das Schlagwort Digitale Souveränität der Türöffner für mehr Open-Source-Software in Behörden, Verwaltungen, Schulen und anderen öffentlichen Einrichtungen, oder erweist sich das als Bumerang? Sind Big Tech, die doch viel in Linux und Open Source investieren, wirklich das Problem?</abstract>
        <description>In dieser Sonderfolge des c’t uplink blicken wir kritisch auf den Begriff Digitale Souveränität und diskutieren, welche Konzepte sich dahinter verbergen. Wir sprechen darüber, ob und warum gerade die Community den Karren aus dem Dreck ziehen soll. Außerdem schauen wir, warum es nur so langsam vorwärts geht mit freier Software in öffentlicher Hand und welche Lösungswege es gibt oder geben könnte.

Gäste (u.a.):
- Anne Roth, Referentin Digitalpolitik im Bundestag
- Bonnie Mehring, Senior-Projekt-Managerin Free Software Foundation Europe
- Sven Neuhaus, Tech Lead Open-Source-Produkte, Zentrum Digitale Souveränität

        <abstract>Nach den längsten Koalitionsverhandlungen in der zweiten Republik kämpft die Dirndlkoalition gegen Inflation, Budgetdefizit und rechte Volkskanzlerfantasien. Wir geben einen Überblick zum politischen Jahr in Österreich.</abstract>
        <description>Am Beginn des Jahres wollte Herbert Kickl noch Volkskanzler werden, am Ende des Jahres regiert eine Dreierkoalition in Österreich. Wie gewohnt wollen wir auch heuer wieder erzählen, was in der österreichischen Innenpolitik passiert, der Humor soll dabei nicht zu kurz kommen.

        <abstract>Du möchtest auf dem 39C3 neue Leute kennenlernen? In entspannter Runde erhältst du praktische Tipps für den Einstieg und spannende Gespräche. Willkommen sind alle – egal, ob schüchtern oder gesprächig! Offen für: FLINTA</abstract>
        <description>Auf den ersten Blick sind Veranstaltungen wie der 39C3 eine super Gelegenheit, Gleichgesinnte kennenzulernen und den eigenen Freundeskreis zu erweitern.
In der Praxis ist das aber oft gar nicht so einfach, wie es klingt. Vielleicht habt ihr euch auch schon einmal gefragt:
- Ist es eigentlich okay, andere einfach so anzusprechen?
- Mit welchen Fragen gelingt der Gesprächseinstieg?
- Wie bleibt ein Gespräch für beide Seiten interessant?

In diesem Workshop verfolgen wir zwei Ziele:
1. Ihr lernt euch in lockerer Atmosphäre untereinander kennen und habt somit schon einmal ein paar bekannte Gesichter auf dem Kongress dazugewonnen.
2. Ihr bekommt praktisches Handwerkszeug, das es euch erleichtert, auf dem Kongress (und darüber hinaus) Gespräche mit euch unbekannten Personen zu starten und zu führen.

Und natürlich soll der Spaß dabei nicht zu kurz kommen!
Egal, ob ihr eher schüchtern oder extrovertiert seid – bei diesem Workshop seid ihr herzlich willkommen.

Offen für: FLINTA

        <abstract>Wie wählt man zwischen mehreren Optionen? Und zwar so, dass danach möglichst viele Leute zufrieden mit dem Ergebnis sind?&#13;
Es gibt mehr Möglichkeiten als nur "die Option mit den meisten Stimmen gewinnt". Wir möchten möglichst viele davon mit euch ausprobieren!</abstract>
        <description>Welche Wahlsysteme gibt es überhaupt so, und wo werden sie üblicherweise eingesetzt? Welche Vor- und Nachteile haben sie, und gibt es "ein bestes"?

Wir werden verschiedene Wahlsysteme ausprobieren und diskutieren, wie sehr sie uns zufrieden stellen und für welche Einsatzgebiete sie geeignet sind. Dazu gibt es Fun Facts und mathematische Hintergründe.

Und was bedeutet das alles für euch in der Praxis, wenn ihr zum Beispiel in eurem Hackspace einen Vorstand wählen wollt?

### System overload? Executive dysfunction in progress? Willkommen im Chaos!

Dieser Workshop ist für alle neurodivergenten FLINTA\* (Frauen, Lesben, inter, nicht-binäre, trans und agender Personen). Gemeinsam schaffen wir Raum für Austausch, gegenseitige Unterstützung und Sichtbarkeit neurodiverser Erfahrungen – von ADHS über Autismus bis Tourette und darüber hinaus.

Wir starten mit einer kurzen Vorstellungsrunde, sammeln gemeinsam Themen und tauchen dann in zwei aufeinanderfolgende Kleingruppenphasen à 30 Minuten ein. So kannst du zu mehreren Themen reinspringen, dich austauschen, zuhören oder einfach dabeisein.
Bringt gerne eure eigenen Themen, Fragen oder Gedanken mit – alles, was euch bewegt, hat hier Platz.

Wenn ihr nach den 2h noch in Gesprächen vertieft seid, könnt ihr es euch in der Haecksen Assembly neben dem Workshopraum gemütlich machen - ganz ohne Zeitlimit, ganz im eigenen Tempo

Dieser Workshop ist ein Safe Space für FLINTA\* , um neurodivergente Erfahrungen aus dieser Perspektive zu teilen, neues zu lernen und sich gegenseitig zu stärken.
Keine Diagnose nötig, kein Druck: Wenn die Zeitblindheit kickt oder das Chaos zu viel wird – komm später, geh früher, alles okay!

- - -
System overload? Executive dysfunction in progress? Welcome to the chaos!

This workshop is for all neurodivergent FLINTA* individuals (women, lesbians, intersex, non-binary, trans, and agender people). Together we'll create space for exchange, mutual support, and visibility of neurodiverse experiences - from ADHD to autism to Tourette's and beyond.

We'll start with a brief round of introductions, gather some topics, and then dive into two consecutive small group sessions of 30 minutes each. This way you can jump into multiple topics, share experiences, listen, or simply be present.
Feel free to bring your own topics, questions, or thoughts - whatever is currently on your mind.

If you're still deep in conversation after the 90 minutes are over, you're welcome to continue in the Haecksen Assembly next to the workshop room without any time limit, completely at your own pace.

This is a safe space for FLINTA* folks to share neurodivergent experiences from this perspective, learn new things, and support each other.

No diagnosis required, no pressure: If time blindness kicks in or the chaos gets overwhelming, feel free to come late or leave early, whatever works for you!

        <abstract>Aufgrund des Supportendes von Windows 10, zielt die endof10-Kampagne darauf ab, Unterstützungsnetzwerke aufzubauen, um Menschen beim Umstieg auf Linux zu unterstützen. &#13;
&#13;
Aber wie können die betroffenen Menschen erreicht werden, die vielleicht noch nie von Linux gehört haben?</abstract>
        <description>Mit Linux können Computer, die nicht die Hardware - Voraussetzungen für Windows 11 erfüllen, noch lange sicher weiter betrieben werden. In einer kurzen Einführung von ca. 20 Minuten, möchte ich meinen Weg beschreiben, wie ich mich immer mehr in der Endof10-Kampagne engagiert habe, obwohl ich keine Linux-Expertin bin.

Ich möchte meine Erfahrungen mit dem Organisieren von Linux-Veranstaltungen in Berlin mit euch teilen und darüber sprechen, wie mein Netzwerk immer mehr gewachsen ist.

Für den Umstieg auf Linux richte ich mich mit meinen Unterstützungsangeboten hauptsächlich an ältere, aufgeschlossene Menschen. Diese leben entweder in meiner Nachbarschaft oder sind in politischen Gruppen aktiv.
Es gibt auch eine Kooperation mit dem Technikmuseum in Berlin, wo wir einmal im Monat ein Linux-Café anbieten.

Anschließend möchte ich euch einladen, Ideen und Erfahrungen darüber auszutauschen, wie auch ihr Teil dieses globalen Graswurzel Unterstützungsnetzwerks werden könnt (falls ihr nicht schon dabei seid).
Wichtig ist dabei lediglich, dass euch das Thema wichtig ist (z.B wegen Vermeidung von Elektroschrott oder Unabhängigkeit von Microsoft). Jede Person hat etwas, das sie beitragen kann.


FLINTA-Only.  Die Unterstützungsstrukturen sind bisher stark männlich geprägt. Über mehr Sichtbarkeit von FLINTA-Personen in diesem Bereich würde ich mich freuen.

        <abstract>Drei Handarbeits-Workshops finden zeitgleich statt!&#13;
&#13;
**Häkeln:**&#13;
Im Workshop wir eine Tampon-förmige Baumwollhülle gehäkelt, in der ein (verpackter) Tampon Platz hat und transportiert werden kann.&#13;
&#13;
**Sticken:**&#13;
Wir treffen uns in entspannter Runde, um gemeinsam Kreuzstich zu lernen und zu sticken. Keine Vorerfahrung erforderlich! Kits, Nähmaterial und Vorlagen mit bunten chaosnahen Motiven sind vorhanden. Kommt gerne auch mit euren eigenen Projekten und setzt euch dazu :3&#13;
&#13;
**Stricken:**&#13;
Stricktreffen für Anfänger\*innen und alle, die ein paar Maschen beim 39c3 stricken wollen und Ihre Skills weitergeben wollen.&#13;
Knitting gathering for beginners and everyone else interested in knitting a few stitches at 39c3, and sharing their skills with beginners.</abstract>
        <description>**Häkeln mit anma**
Häkel Deine eigene Tampon-Hülle, die praktischer Weise auch Tampon-förmig ist und am Rucksack getragen oder schwungvoll durch die Luft gewirbelt nicht nur ein fantastischer Gesprächsstarter ist, sondern auch ein Statement gegen die Tabuisierung der Menstruation.
Ob für Dich selbst, als Geschenk oder als origineller Anhänger für den Weihnachtsbaum oder Osterstrauß - die Einsatzmöglichkeiten sind endlos.
Wir verwenden einfaches Baumwollgarn in passenden Farben: klassisch weiß oder natur bis hin zu Rottönen für den "Used look". Häkelkenntnisse sind von Vorteil, aber nicht zwingend erforderlich.

Der Workshop ist für alle interessierten Personen offen.

**Sticken mit rhandos**
Wir treffen uns in entspannter Runde, um gemeinsam Kreuzstich zu lernen und zu sticken. Keine Vorerfahrung erforderlich! Ich bringe Kits, Nähmaterial und Vorlagen mit bunten chaosnahen Motiven mit. Kommt gerne auch mit euren eigenen Projekten und setzt euch dazu :3

Eine Liste der Motive findet ihr hier:
https://git.hamburg.ccc.de/rhandos/crossstitch-patterns

Ich bringe genug Kits für alle mit. Wenn ihr außerhalb des Workshops ein Kit (mit Stoff, Nadel, Vorlage und Garn) zum Selbstkostenpreis reservieren wollt, schreibt mich gerne unter Angabe des Motivs an.

---

**Stricken/Knitting mit Sarah**
Ich möchte einen Strickworkshop / ein Stricktreffen für Anfänger\*innen und alle, die ein paar Maschen beim 39c3 stricken wollen und Ihre Skills weitergeben wollen, anbieten. Stricken ist eine tolle Fertigkeit, die Du Dir am besten "learning by doing" mit anderen zusammen aneignen kannst. Anfänger\*innen könnten sofort einige Grundlagen lernen oder über Projektideen sprechen. Falls Interesse besteht, können wir über das upcycling alter Pullover(garne) sprechen.

I would like to offer a knitting workshop / gathering for beginners and everyone else interested in knitting a few stitches at 39c3, and sharing their skills with beginners. I think knitting it is a wonderful skill best to be learned by doing and face to face. Beginners could learn some basics straight away, or talk about project ideas. If there is anyone interested in talking about the re-use / upcycling of old sweaters &amp; sweater yarn, we could also do that.

        <description>Hi, I'm Li0n. I'm transmasc, and I'd really like to meet more nerdy transmascs. if you feel the same way, please come say hi. we transmascs can be quite invisible sometimes, each walking around as individuals, never finding each other, always having to figure things out by ourselves. I would like to make a change to that and build solidarity and support between transmascs in the CCC community.

        <abstract>Austauschrunde über Freud und Leid der Transition und allen Themen, die euch drumherum beschäftigen.&#13;
&#13;
Nicht cis Personen only, d. h. offen für TINA (trans, inter, non-binary, agender).</abstract>
        <description>Nicht cis Personen only

Der Weg der Transition ist für jede*n sehr individuell und trotzdem gibt es viele Überschneidungen. Mensch bemerkt die ersten Veränderungen und kann diese nicht einordnen oder bekommt eine Ablehnung oder Zusage von der Krankenkasse. Erzähl uns von deinen Erfahrungen, denn hier findest du Leute, die ähnliche Erlebnisse oder Erfahrungen gemacht haben. Eventuell standen diese vor einem ähnlichen Problem und wissen, wie es weiter gehen kann oder du willst einfach deine aktuelle Freude teilen. Lass uns austauschen, denn gemeinsam sind wir stärker.

Wie letztes Jahr, sollen am Anfang kurz Themencluster gefunden und dann in kleineren Gruppen an Tischen weiter bearbeitet, diskutiert oder sich gegenseitig damit geholfen werden.

Das Ganze findet dann in drei Runden á 15 min statt, damit die Teilnehmenden die Möglichkeit haben, über mehrere Themen zu reden.

Improvisierte elektronische Musik auf einem hybriden Setup, bestehend aus einem kleinen modularen System und digitalen Komponenten, die in Pure Data programmiert sind. Der Fokus liegt auf der musikalischen Erforschung roher elektronischer Klänge ohne den Einsatz von Echo, Hall oder Loopern. Auch wenn es rhythmische Momente geben mag, stehen diese nicht im Mittelpunkt, ebenso wenig wie Harmonie und Melodie – vielmehr sind technische/mathematische Strukturen die Ausgangspunkte. Die ästhetische Anziehungskraft entsteht durch die Akzeptanz des Klangmoments als kognitive Erfahrung und die gemeinsame Wahrnehmung eines Spannungsbogens durch Publikum und Performer*in.</abstract>
        <description>Improvised electronic music on a hybrid setup consisting of a small modular system and digital components programmed in Pure Data. The focus is on the musical exploration of raw electronic sounds without the use of echoes, reverb, or loopers. Even though there may be rhythmic moments, these are not the focus, nor are harmony and melody—rather, technical/mathematical structures are the starting points. The aesthetic appeal arises from the acceptance of the sound moment as a cognitive experience and the shared perception of a tension arc by the audience and performer.

#### Artist Bio:

i am an electronic/experimental musician, composer, improviser, programmer based in leipzig/germany.

after more than 3 decades as a professional musician and instrumental teacher in various styles and on various traditional instruments, i have become a little bored and saturated with it. in addition, i have felt the desire to devote my life to other tasks such as left wing political, activist work and exploring the social space. therefore i have decided to stop making traditional music and to focus musically on improvisation and electronic sound generation.

this allows me to combine some strong interests - for example, exploring sounds, computer programming, electronic tinkering - and use them for my artistic work. i play live with a small modular system as well as with self-developed digital, computer-based instruments and controllers. in addition to ensemble 
improvisation, i am increasingly interested in solo performances. through my long time as a wind instrumentalist i have become accustomed to always using my breath for articulation and dynamic control. 
that's why i usually use a breath controller for my electronic performances.
in this concert i expect to use an eurorack-modular in combination with pure data &amp; supercollider

        <abstract>Der Theatertechniker Elias baut zusammen mit seinen Freunden ein voll funktionsfähiges Steampunk-U-Boot. Während Nico Menschen aus den Wellen des Mittelmeers rettet, rät der 70-jährige Künstler Jim: „Tu es nicht. Repariere keine Autos, sondern mach lieber etwas im Leben, was du wirklich willst.“ Elias fragt sich: Muss man sich zwischen Selbstverwirklichung und selbstlosem Handeln entscheiden? Wovon hängt die Verantwortung gegenüber Einzelpersonen oder der Gesellschaft insgesamt ab?</abstract>
        <description>**Artist: Christoph Fleischer**

**Genre: Documentary, 92 min**

*DE with EN subtitles, 2024*

Theatre engineer Elias builds a fully functional steampunk submarine together with his friends. While Nico rescues people from the waves of the Mediterranean, the 70-year-old artist Jim advises: ”Don‘t do it. Don’t fix cars, but rather do something in life that you really want to”. Elias asks himself: Is there a decision to be made between self-realization and selfless-action? Upon what does responsibility towards individuals or larger society depend?

ABOUT WATER AND DREAMS is a philosophical journey that questions the meaningfulness of our actions and dares to dream publicly in our dreamless society.


Documentary film about the submarine project presented at 37C3 with a lecture.

        <abstract>This session looks at where open hardware is heading, starting from recent ground up developments at FOSSASIA and extending to global trends across the open hardware community. With perspectives from FOSSASIA developers and open hardware experts, it explores decentralised collaboration, open silicon and firmware stacks, manufacturing realities, and how openness can be sustained at scale.</abstract>
        <description>In 2025, teams at FOSSASIA initiated several open hardware projects developed entirely from the ground up, including a new ARM based Pocket Science Lab, an updated LED Badge platform, and an NFC powered ePaper badge enabling energy independent content transfer. However, this session goes beyond a project update. It situates these developments within a wider global movement of open hardware initiatives across Asia, Europe, and other regions. Drawing on experiences from FOSSASIA as well as broader perspectives from the international open hardware community, the talk examines where open hardware is heading as a decentralised, collaborative practice. With input from international experts and community contributors, the session will explore trends emerging, including evolving manufacturing models, open silicon and firmware stacks, supply chain resilience, and the realities of sustaining openness at scale.

        <abstract>Build your own open-source Bitcoin signing device with a Raspberry Pi Zero, camera and display! We have kits for 45€</abstract>
        <description>Seedsigners are open-source DIY signing devices which can be built using "normal" hardware like a Raspberry Pi and act as kind of hardware wallets to sign Bitcoin transactions. Since the hardware is missing a secure element chip, the keys are saved externally, usually via self-drawn QR-codes which are read again for every use via the build-in camera.

We brought a few kits with us which we sell for 45€ and build together. We will solder the 40pin GPIO header to the Raspberry Pi Zero, flashing the firmware on the MicroSD card and then build everything together in the 3d-printed enclosure.

The kit includes:
Raspberry Pi Zero 1.3 (without Wifi or Bluetooth chip), GPIO-header to solder
Display-Hat with joystick and buttons
Camera
64GB MicroSD card
MicroUSB to USB-C cable
3D printed enclosure
6 printed templates for self-drawn QR-Codes

        <abstract>Free/libre software promotes users' rights, safeguards privacy, individual control over technology and fosters autonomy and decentralisation within our communities. In contrast, proprietary software limits user freedoms leading to centralised monopolies that often misuse their power to oppress and exploit. This imbalance can result in malware, degradation of privacy and service enshitification. Unfortunately, many remain unaware of the unjustices created by proprietary software, but increased awareness and shift towards free software can fuel resistance.&#13;
&#13;
Replacing of proprietary software is a crucial first step to liberate users, yet many need support to make this transition successfully. Workshops for system installation, repair centres and tech-savvy friends can offer essential assistance. However, what is the most effective way to offer this support? Which software should be recommended and how to engage the novice users while minimising the challenges associated with the transition?&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop we aim to discuss possible strategies of providing information on the path to software freedom. We will examine the installation process and ongoing use of free software within our circles. Key topics will include sparking interest in free distributions, selecting ideal software configuration, and exploring various forms of assistance during installation. Additionally, we'll address onboarding into the new system and troubleshooting potential issues. Finally, we hope to gather and share ideas on streamlining the process for everyone involved.</abstract>

        <abstract>The right to respect for digital integrity is an emerging right to protect people's digital lives. &#13;
&#13;
This talk will introduce this new legal concept, its possible implications for data protection and how this concept is being introduced in the current legal framework. The talk will also be an update of the implementation work with the adoption of the right in the Constitution of Geneva voted with 94% approval rate on the 18th of June 2023 and with 91% in Neuchâtel in November 2024. Zurich will be voting in November 2025.</abstract>
        <description>Every human evolves today in multi-dimensional physical and digital environment. If each individual is to keep its individuality and autonomy in its choices, it must be protected and given effective tools to defend its own autonomy.

Recognizing that human life has been digitally extended must question ourselves on what makes us human today. Should personal data be considered as component of the person, rather than objects that can be owned by whoever collects that data? Should our digital integrity be protected?

If each human person already has a right to physical and mental integrity (Swiss Constitution article 10 al.2), shouldn’t it have a right to digital integrity?

Alexis Roussel has been co-authoring a book on the right to Digital Integrity. He is an advocate in digital public policies in Switzerland.

        <title>The Mask-Off Moment for Digital Identity</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <language>en</language>
        <track/>
        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Digital identity is sold as a path to trust, inclusion, and "digital empowerment." In practice, it is a brittle control surface: a set of design choices that decide who is seen, who is excluded, and who can be targeted at scale.&#13;
&#13;
Born from a landmark research project, _The Digital Identity Event Horizon_, this talk describes the 2025 "mask-off moment" for digital identity: the point where multiple comforting narratives collapse and the core use of identity systems as population-management infrastructure becomes hard to deny. Using short vignettes from New Design Congress case-study work (Estonia, the US, Australia, Gaza, and others), it shows how ambiguity, vendor incentives, and governance theatre turn identity into fraud-permissive, coercion-ready infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
In response to this decline, this talk concludes proposes a working model of the digital self as a socio-technical system with six properties: serialisation, custodianship, presentation, authentication, authorisation, and assetisation, and offers new framing and threat models to help understand how digital identity creates brittle societies.</abstract>
        <description>Despite decades of cryptography, security practice, and best practice deployment, digital identity remains the weakest link in systems design because its core terms stay vague while its consequences are concrete. What does it actually take to assemble a digital identity? What do different implementations share, even when they claim to be radically different? And what happens when those definitions are left elastic enough to serve whoever holds power?

"The mask-off moment" tracks the convergence of capability (biometrics, sensors, AI triage, mass digitisation), institutional incentives (risk scoring, eligibility gates, compliance automation), and political will. The result is an emerging form of bureaucratic violence we are not prepared to name, much less govern.

This talk traces how digital identity became weapon-ready through optimistic framing and opportunistic ambiguity, then offers a concrete frame to interrogate any proposal: what it will do on its best day, what it will do on its worst day, and which parts of the system will be impossible to “add accountability to later.” The intended audience is policymakers, technologists, designers, and civil-society people who are tired of vague promises and want a usable model that survives contact with reality.

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Namecoin has been used in the wild for years as a TLS Public Key Infrastructure, and using Tor onion services with TLS has been nearing deployment as well. But what kinds of other PKI wizardry can we do with Namecoin and Tor?</abstract>
        <description>Topics to be covered include:

* How we can use Namecoin as a PKI with ~0 bytes of blockchain overhead.
* How Namecoin's smart contract functionality (allowing multisig and timelocks to control updating a name) interacts with PKI use cases.
* How we generalized Namecoin and Tor PKI to work with non-TLS protocols.
* How revocations can be handled securely.
* How we ensured anonymity (including Tor stream isolation) despite TLS implementations not providing API's for this.
* How the anonymity protections actually *improved* performance.
* How all of the above interoperates with existing software.

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>A walk-through of how to contribute to open source projects, with Stack Wallet, Monero, and Tor (Arti!) as examples. A quick guide to setting up development environments for each on Linux, macOS, and/or Windows, an update on where each project stands, and a list of big and small tasks to do for each. A "quickstart" guide for newcomers and a survey of outstanding TODOs for more experienced hands.</abstract>
        <description>Starting with Tor and The Tor Project's new Rust project Arti (A Rust Tor Implementation), we'll walk through how to build, set up for development, and submit Pull Requests which have a good chance of being accepted.  We'll proceed to Monero development, both for the original C++ codebase as well as the newer Cuprate project, a Rust Monero implementation, and what's coming for both.  Finally, we'll look at how Stack Wallet incorporates and provides a UX for both Tor and Monero.

        <abstract>Chaos Communication Congress (C3) is a big annual event for people who love technology, cybersecurity, free culture, and creativity. Since 1984, it has been held in Germany, first mostly in German, then in English to connect people worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
Today, thanks to International Sign (IS), everyone deaf or hearing can fully join. IS makes communication open, equal, and accessible, helping people overcome language barriers and work together.&#13;
&#13;
There are over 300 sign languages in the world, some more than 5,000 years old. IS has been used for several decades by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and the Deaflympics Games (ICSD). These organizations used to have a hierarchy, but today IS allows a holarchy, where everyone has a place and communication is shared equally.&#13;
&#13;
A big question is: why choose English instead of International Sign? English helps hearing people communicate worldwide. But IS allows deaf and hearing people to connect more equally, opening space for sharing and understanding deaf cultures.</abstract>
        <description>In a world dominated by surveillance and digital control, oral languages are constantly monitored, but sign languages remain largely invisible to automated systems. This session explores the intersection of hacker culture, Deaf culture, and communication, questioning dominant linguistic norms and hearing privilege. Participants will experiment with sign language as a tool for privacy, creativity, and subversion, explore collaborative multilingual communication, and reflect on the politics of visibility and language power. Open to all signers, non-signers, and curious minds ready to hack communication.

Key themes:

Surveillance and privacy

Hacking communication

Sign language as a free / untraceable space

Politics of visibility and language power

Experimentation, creativity, and reinvention of norms

Come discover "version 0.9" for its launch, a playtest and discussion!</abstract>
        <description>WEKILL//LEAKS is a 2-player card game.

Have you ever dreamt of running THE EMPIRE? Of limitlessly expanding your economic, political and military power through the World at any cost, including through war and deception? Do you have what it takes to crush your political opponents – those who disagree with your methods and want to expose them – in order to impose your warmongering agenda?

Or have you ever dreamt of organizing THE LEAK? Of leading data-driven journalism online into the future? Will you be capable of combining the powers of digital technologies and investigative journalism to expose the crimes and lies of the Empire? To give everyone the power to understand the World they live in, and act upon it?

Whether you want to side with Power or with Courage… WEKILL//LEAKS is a game for you!

Each player choses to play either as “The Empire” or as a mysterious organisation called “The Leak”.

This is the release of "version 0.9", as the game is currently in pre-final-stage of testing and fine-tuning.

Come join to discover the game, discuss its design and playtest it!

The glossy box-set contains the following:

-  2 Decks of 40 illustrated color cards, made of prime 330g/m² coated “casino-grade” black-core cardboard
-  1 Score-keeping card
-  1 Color manual
-  3 Laser-cut tokens for score-keeping

You can also get your own copy of the game, and support the project financially directly, or on https://opencollective.com/dissent-and-datalove

Social sharing of Cannabis is still prohibited. But nobody can keep us from showing our harvest to each other, discussing it.

No competition. No "cup". Just cozy get-together.\
Let's celebrate the survival of the partial legalization.

Maybe we can realize a seed exchange. Bring along what you have left.

sybb - show your best bud\
byow - bring your own weed

        <description>Almost all of us have some connection to the topic, but we want to give you a chance to share what is going on in your country or city, how your fight for maintaining our digital rights looks like.
You'll have the chance to share in a lightning-talk style what you or your organisation has been up to, no longer than 3 minutes, so bring your stories if you'd like.
Afterwards we'll probably have plenty of topics to talk about, and continue over a Tschunk or two.

We'll cover how the GDPR screwed up privacy in Portugal and how the law effectively gags the data protection authority, among other outrageous examples. We'll share some of our initial efforts in a data analysis project to correlate public contracts with deployed surveillance systems and we welcome ideas / lessons from others who've engaged in similar initiatives.</abstract>

        <abstract>This workshop aims to equip techies and activists with some understanding to recognize and address emotional concerns in the context of digital rights. Together, let’s cultivate a flourishing community that prioritizes well-being and empowerment in the face of technology-driven challenges.</abstract>
        <description>Join us for an engaging and transformative workshop designed specifically for techies and digital rights activists. In an era increasingly defined by surveillance and technological risks, it's essential to address the emotional toll these challenges take on our community and beyond.

During this interactive session, participants will:

Reflect Together: Engage in a moment of introspection and heartfelt group discussions about the emotions surrounding surveillance, technology, and associated risks. Learn to actively listen and share your experiences in a supportive environment where your feelings are validated.

Brainstorm Solutions: Explore ways our communities can provide more support to their members and be generous towards a broader audience, particularly those unfamiliar with digital rights issues. Learn how to communicate effectively about these feelings and provide alternatives and resources for those feeling overwhelmed.

Experience Safe Spaces: Throughout the workshop, we will create an emotionally safe space that allows participants to experience firsthand what a supportive environment feels like. This is not just a theoretical exercise, but a practice in fostering community resilience and mutual care.

Additionally, participants will receive comprehensive material to help them easily reproduce this workshop in their own communities. With these tools, you'll be empowered to extend the conversation and emotional support to others who share similar feelings about the challenges posed by technology.

        <title>The Digital Identity Event Horizon</title>

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Despite years of information security innovation, user safety continues to decay and digital systems remain vulnerable. The reason: most attacks exploit a flawed first principle of digital identity, built on entrenched assumptions about presentation, authentication, enforcement, and trust. As societies digitize and digital identity becomes the endpoint for all contact between citizens, institutions, and infrastructure, this collective failure to imagine new designs will shatter how we cultivate social trust. How else can this state of affairs, where no single attribute of a person can escape the reach of bad actors, be brought to an end?&#13;
&#13;
Drawing on unprecedented access to individuals across the digital identity landscape and organisations developing the next wave of identity solutions, The Digital Identity Event Horizon presents New Design Congress' analysis of the core emerging socio-technical threats inherent in all digital identity systems, and lays the case for why proposed solutions will not address these threats without radical rethinking.</abstract>
        <description>What happens when threat modelling becomes reality? This is the story of a research team caught in the mask-off moment for digital identity, documenting the technology's inherent dangers at the exact moment its weaponised design revealed itself.

Over four years, New Design Congress conducted eight case studies across implementations ranging from national biometric schemes to Web3 zero-knowledge proofs. More than 45 participants, including law enforcement officers, military personnel, information security researchers, CEOs, and activists, spoke candidly about digital identity's failure modes. The resulting 600+ citations documented a fundamental problem: the Cartesian vulnerability. "I authenticate, therefore I am" - when proving identity becomes inseparable from possessing identity, social-engineering attacks become inevitable. When identity infrastructure becomes a single point of failure, it tears at the fabric of society itself.

Since 2021, New Design Congress has applied adversarial security research methodology to the question of flawed digital identity: its definitions, implementations, and implications. From FaceID to BankID, from Facebook to the fediverse, from Worldcoin to the world's passports, this is an exhaustive study of the opportunities and risks that emerge from how we represent entities in the information age. At the centre is a core hypothesis: today's digital identities are inherently vulnerable to attack, and this leads to brittle digital societies.

This talk presents the threats and findings for the first time. It is for anyone who still believes today's technologies can safely represent humans. The report it is based on, The Digital Identity Event Horizon, is a landmark adversarial study that names the concrete harms of digital identity directly, establishes a working definition, introduces a threat modeling framework for evaluating any scheme, and presents ten key findings and fourteen recommendations, with many immediately  implementable across policy, design, and governance.

The report will be soft-launched at https://newdesigncongress.org/en/report/2026/the-digital-identity-event-horizon.

Wir starten mit ganz einfachen Schritten. Bei Bedarf helfe ich Dir. 
Im zweiten Teil geht es dann um sogenannte custom roms, die „entgoogled“ sind,  wie IodéOS, GrapheneOS, etc. und eine kurzer Abstecher zu Linux-Smartphones.

        <abstract>Die UN-Cybercrime-Konvention ist ein völkerechtliches Abkommen, das in vieler Hinsicht das Gegenteil zu Menschenrechtskonventionen darstellt. Statt Menschen zu stärken, wird deren Überwachung, völkerrechtlich verpflichtend, in den Blick genommen. Klingt dystopisch? Ist es. Was hat sich da verdreht? Ist es wirklich so krass und schlimm? Und was lässt sich da machen?</abstract>
        <description>Nach einer kleinen Einführung aus dezidiert nicht-juristischer Perspektive wollen wir diskutieren, welche Auswirkungen von dem Papier zu erwarten sind, wie sich Einzelne und Staaten (so sie Willens sind), dagegen wehren können. Und natürlich, wie das Problem überhaupt bekannter gemacht werden kann.

        <abstract>Content warning! Expect a rather ‘erotic’ reading of stories based on extracts of our research, brewed by a quirky mind.</abstract>
        <description>This is a reading of some red-tape-diary stories, based on FediVariety’s deep package inspection on the EDPS’s ‘EU Voice/Video’ pilot project—but with a juicy twist! Every character is real, each event actually happened, and all quotes are genuine. However, all of this will be ridiculously tweaked.

Views are very personal, none of the involved (EU) organisations or individuals accept any liability for damage of any kind resulting from the risks inherent in the erotic transmission of messages.

About the speaker
(Cpt.) ZZEPPOSS’s lifelong passion for technology was ignited by a childhood fascination with screwdrivers, electro-mechanical pinball machines, klunker bikes, the treasures found in his dad’s workshop… and garbage dumpsites. This fervent enthusiasm puzzled his parents and teachers for years, as it continues to baffle his colleagues, compatriots, and friends to this day. ‘Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.' is his leitmotif (cfr. WEC).

        <abstract>No prior knowledge required!&#13;
Want to make your Android smartphone more privacy-friendly? I'll show you what you can do with your existing device. In the second part, I'll discuss ‘Google-free’ Android variants (custom ROMs) and Linux smartphones.</abstract>
        <description>Tired of every app knowing exactly where you are? Tired of receiving personalised advertising that doesn't suit you anyway? I'll show you which settings you can adjust on your Android smartphone so that you can be a little less open with your data. No prior knowledge is required. We'll start with some very simple steps. I'll help you if you need it. 
The second part will then cover so-called custom ROMs that are ‘de-Googled’, such as IodéOS, GrapheneOS, etc., and a brief detour to Linux smartphones.

        <abstract>Introduction to Parks on the Air (POTA). POTA is an international radiosport award program that encourages licensed amateur radio operators to visit, enjoy and operate portable equipment in a variety of parks and public lands.</abstract>
        <description>POTA introduction "in a nutshell" followed by joint POTA activation on shortwave in the "Planten un Blomen" park right next to the CCH.

We meet daily at 01:00 p.m. at the Assembly for a short introduction and then go out into the park together. The participants learn how to set up a portable shortwave station and get a crash course in shortwave operation. Then it's time to get on the air! Other radio amateurs around the world are waiting to contact us. Can you manage the 10 radio connections necessary for a successful "activation" of the park?

NOTE: We meet AT THE CHAOSWELLE ASSEMBLY and start there with a short introduction to the POTA program. Then we go out into the park together. Dress warmly and weatherproof! We go outside even when it's raining or snowing!

If anyone wants to join us later: radio amateurs can reach us in the park on 145.500 MHz FM.

In this short talk, I explain how I wanted to change that, how I probably overengineered things in the process, and whether anything came of it in the end—apart from some nice stamps.

        <description>Das c3Awareness-Team wird uns auch in diesem Jahr mit reichlich Erfahrung zur Seite stehen. Wir freuen uns sehr auf deine Teilnahme.

In einem Awareness-Team sind Menschen, die sich darum kümmern, dass es allen gut geht. Sie sind ansprechbar, wenn wer traurig ist, wenn es Streit gibt oder gab, wenn sich wer ausgegrenzt oder ungerecht behandelt fühlt. So ein Team im Kidspace, das wäre doch wunderbar! Und weil es der Kidspace ist, sollen das natürlich auch junge Menschen sein.

Im Workshop schauen wir uns an, was ein Awareness-Team im Kidspace machen könnte, wie ihr als Teil dieses Teams mit konkreten Situationen umgehen könnt und wie ihr dabei gut auf euch achtet. Wir sprechen über Gefühle, Bedürfnisse, Ausgrenzung, Verschiedenheit und Geheimnisse.

Wenn du zwischen 10 und 15 Jahren bist und Lust hast, beim Kidspace-Awareness-Team mitzumachen, komm zum Workshop :)

Der Workshop findet gemeinsam mit Mitgliedern des c3Awareness-Teams der Gesamt-Veranstaltung und Menschen aus der Kidspace-Orga statt. ghenny und bunthörnchen als Teil des Kidspace werden das entstehende Awareness-Team begleiten und bei Bedarf ansprechbar sein.

        <description>Wir, ein paar Menschen aus dem Umfeld des Chaostreffs des c3RE, haben zum 37c3 ein PCB in Form eines Getränkeuntersetzer im Congress-Design entworfen. Zunächst nur für uns und … ach komm… wir machen ein paar mehr. 
An Tag 0 waren alle PCBs weg!
Zum 38c3 gab es nicht nur eine Neuauflage im aktuellen Design sondern auch noch eine Nachproduktion vom 37c3. 
An Tag 1 waren alle PCBs weg!
Zum 39c3 gibt es nun die dritte Auflage - wieder im aktuellen Congress-Design, mit 3 Widerständen, einem MOSfet und 8 RGB LEDs wird das Ganze mit einem Wemos D1 Mini zu einem leuchtenden, blinkenden Erinnerungsstück an deinen (ersten?) Congress!
Wir haben Lötstationen, helfende Hände aber leider nur begrenzt Platz und Zeit.
Wir werden verschiedene Vorbereitungsstufen vorhalten so dass jede und jeder -unabhängig von der Löterfahrung- am Ende ein PCB zum leuchten bringen kann.
Bitte meldet euch an damit wir planen können:
kohlenpod@c3re.de

Die Kosten für die Hardware inkl. Wemos betragen ca. 5€ - es wäre nett wenn ihr euch an den Kosten beteiligt - dies ist aber absolut kein Muss!

P.S: wir haben auch noch eine kleine Menge an 37C3 und 38C3 PCBs nachbestellt - damit die Menschen die gerne sammeln die Chance haben alle PCBs zu bekommen. Die sind übrigens untereinander kompatibel und können gestapelt werden

        <description>Im Erste-Hilfe-Kurs zeigen wir euch, wie man Pflaster bei sich oder anderen klebt, damit ihr kleinere Verletzungen selbst verarzten könnt. Wenn ihr schon älter seid oder mehr Erfahrung mitbringt, können wir uns zudem an Verbänden und der stabilen Seitenlage versuchen. Wichtig ist zudem, zu erkennen, wann jemand Hilfe braucht. Daher bringen wir auch ein Bilderrätsel mit. Mit den Bildern können wir mögliche Gefahren und Handlungen besprechen. Eine mögliche Handlung ist, einen Notruf abzusetzen. Daher werden wir dies mit euch üben. Zum Schluss werden wir schauen, was man mit Einmalhandschuhen noch so anstellen kann.

Weird is wonderful! Crooked cucumbers, bent carrots, and limp potatoes are not only delicious, but also fun music controllers for earthy sounds. How does it work? You connect the vegetables to your computer, record weird and wonderful sounds using the vegetable keys, and use them to create your own beats. One of the most popular workshop at this year's Code Week Hamburg—come by and join us in making weird sounds from Krautrock to cable salad.

        <abstract>Wir begeben uns auf eine Entdeckungsreise durch Linux - von der Vielfalt eines Betriebssystems. Was ist (F)OSS? Wie sieht so ein Linux aus? Was kann man damit machen? Und kann man damit auch spielen?</abstract>
        <description>Wir wollen Linux für Schule und Freizeit zeigen, die Vorteile von freier OpenSource Software erklären, die Vielfalt der verfügbaren Programme und Tools sowie mit dem Vorurteil aufräumen, dass man zum Spielen dann ja doch immer Windows benötigt.

Der Workshop soll an drei Tagen am Beispiel des Schulsticks durch die Vielfalt des Systems führen.

Part 1: Einstieg

Was ist Linux? Was freie Software? Was sind die Vorteile? Wie sieht so ein Linux aus? Welche Flavours gibt es? (Was) kann man damit alles machen? Und dann natürlich: Anwendungen wie z.B. Office, Grafikprogramme selber ausprobieren.

Zielgruppe

Dieser komplette Workshop ist für absolute Neulinge (Computer überhaupt und/oder Linux). Aber auch, wer schon Windows einsetzt und mal über den Tellerrand schauen will, vielleicht sogar schon einmal über einen Wechsel nachgedacht hat, sich aber (noch) nicht traut, ist herzlich willkommen!

Voraussetzungen

Interesse und Neugier.

        <description>Das freie Open-World-Spiel Luanti(Minetest) bietet viele Möglichkeiten, kreativ zu werden und zusammen zu spielen. Das Spielprinzip ist ähnlich zu Minecraft, dennoch ist Luanti ein ganz anderes Spiel und keineswegs ein nachgemachter Klon von Minecraft. Genau genommen ist Luanti ein Framework, also ein Baukasten, mit dem sich alle ihr eigenes Sandbox- oder Voxel-Game nach eigenen Vorstellungen zusammenbauen können.

Wir lernen Luanti und seine Erweiterungsmöglichkeiten kennen und programmieren eine eigene Mod, die dem Spiel individuelle Items hinzufügt. Zudem ist es möglich, eigene Craftingrezepte zu erstellen, mit denen die neuen Blöcke, Items oder Werkzeuge hergestellt werden können. Je nach Interesse und Zeit werden weitere Bereiche, wie das Programmieren von Commands, eingebracht.Freund*innen spielen kann. Dabei gibt es kleinere Mods, die einzelne Elemente des Spiels verändern, aber auch ganze Games, die ein eigenes Spielprinzip mit sich bringen.

[https://teckids.org/projekte/hack-n-fun/workshops/luanti/](https://teckids.org/projekte/hack-n-fun/workshops/luanti/)

Wer sich ein Laptop für den Workshop ausleihen möchte, sollte sich spätestens eine Stunde vor dem Workshop an der Teckids-Assembly im
Digitalcourage-Habitat melden. Wer ein eigenes Laptop benutzen möchte, benötigt ein Linux-System mit Luanti ab Version 5.10.

        <abstract>Let's snack and chat! We want to invite you to collectively reflect the relationship between activism and academic research with us. &#13;
&#13;
As hegemonic and intersectionally discriminatory institutions, universities re-produce global structures of domination and oppression. And regularly, insights from activism inspire academia rather than vice versa. Still, research is a relevant module to understand and meaningfully participate in the world around us. But the line between research and activism becomes blurred anyway. Activists are researchers and researchers are activists, participating in both worlds, oftentimes trying to bring them together. Here, long-term research projects that illuminate specific processes in-depth tend to collide with the rather short-term struggles of activism that need immediate responses to current issues. Therefore, we want to elaborate with you: (How) Can academic research and activism in SAR interact in solidarity?&#13;
&#13;
In our own roles as researchers and activists, we appreciate both forms of working and knowledge-producing and are well aware of challenges and difficulties. Together with you, we want to discuss all these challenges and difficulties - but also work out and underline potentials! &#13;
&#13;
We organized a workshop like this already at the SAR-Camp in September in Biesenthal. We invite people to newly join in and to follow-up. If you like to, bring some snacks or your breakfast, lunch, dinner, ... The format is meant to be low-key and comfortable!</abstract>

        <description>In dieser Session werde ich den OpenStreetMap-Editor JOSM vorgestellen, eine Java-Applikation für das fortgeschrittene Bearbeiten von OpenStreetMap-Daten. Anders als der Online-Editor iD auf der OpenStreetMap-Website sind auch größere Datenmengen mit JOSM bearbeitbar. Die Anwendung kann mit Plugins, eigenen Tagging-Vorlagen und Kartenstilen an die eigenen Bedürfnisse angepasst werden.

Die Session richtet sich an Interessierte, die schon einmal zu OpenStreetMap beigetragen haben und tiefer einsteigen möchten oder Relationen und größere Objekte (z.B. Landnutzungsflächen) bearbeiten möchten.

Der Workshop richtet sich an Leute, die schon einmal OpenStreetMap-Daten bearbeitet haben.

Um zu OpenStreetMap beizutragen, ist ein Benutzerkonto erforderlich. Bitte legt es vor der Session an. Bitte installiert euch JOSM vor der Session (z.B. aus den Paketquellen eurer Linux-Distribution). Achtet bei der Nutzung der Paketquellen eurer Distribution darauf, dass es sich um Version 18678 oder neuer handelt. Andernfalls könnt ihr damit keine Änderungen hochladen.

        <abstract>Fünf Stromerzeuger dominieren den deutschen Strommarkt. Zusätzlich sitzt mit Katherina Reiche eine Person an der Spitze des Wirschafts- und Energieministeriums, die vier Jahre lang eine Führungsposition innerhalb des Energiekonzerns E.ON innehatte. Zwar gibt es Energiegenossenschaften und Balkonkraftwerkbesitzer*innen, die versuchen, sich von diesen Machtstrukturen ein Stück weit unabhängig zu machen, aber sie produzieren nur einen Bruchteil der Energie, die tagtäglich nachgefragt wird. Die Kampagne RWE und co enteignen setzt sich deswegen für einen Strommarkt ein, der nicht länger von Profitinteressen getrieben wird, und arbeitet an einem Plan, wie dies durch Vergesellschaftung umgesetzt werden kann.</abstract>
        <description>Mit der Vergesellschaftung des Energiesektors in NRW wollen wir die Demokratisierung der (Energie)Wirtschaft und eine ernsthafte sozial-ökologische Energiewende erreichen. Auf juristischer Ebene beinhaltet das die Umwandlung von großen privatwirtschaftlich organisierten Unternehmen in Anstalten des öffentlichen Rechts, auf gesellschaftlicher Ebene leitet es einen Paradigmenwechsel ein: von Oligopolstruktur, Intransparenz und riesigen Profitmargen hin zu solidarischen Preismodellen, einem Energiemarkt, der auf Erneuerbare ausgelegt ist und vor allem hin zu einem direkt demokratischen Entscheidungsprozess, an dem alle Betroffenen beteiligt sind - Angestellte, Strombeziehende, von Klimawandel und Energieressourcenabbau Betroffene...

Wie könnten Entscheidungsprozesse in einem vergesellschafteten Betrieb aussehen? Erfüllt unser aktuelles Strommarktdesign die Voraussetzungen dafür? Wie funktioniert unser Energiesystem und warum scheitern privatwirtschaftliche Unternehmen an der Umsetzung der Energiewende? Und wo könnten gesellschaftliche Hebel liegen, um eine Vergesellschaftung auch tatsächlich umzusetzen?

Im Workshop wollen wir unsere Überlegungen dazu vorstellen und sind gleichzeitig auch gespannt auf eure Gedanken zum Thema - denn auch Technik braucht Strom, also lasst uns überlegen, wie Produktion und Verteilung demokratischer organisiert werden können!

This event is dedicated to cider, cidre, sidra or how ever you would like to call beverage prepared by fermentation of apple juice. This event is run by František [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] Apfelbeck and is one of the activities of the [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara/Kvasírna Jara] project which is a commercial one.

'''Aims&amp;Selection'''
The aim of this event is to educate people about cider in a nice and socially friendly environment. It is guided tasting with short foreword and then after opening first bottle just continuing with other ones when talking on the subject of cider and it's making. We provide a high quality selection of ciders focusing on "typical" products, plus we add some really special samples depending what we have available. At the core of the tasting are French ciders, especially from Normandie region and partly Bretagne. From the geographical point of view we generally have at least one sample from North of Spain, Andalusia or Basque. There is cider from England, because of strong connections to Czech Republic we try to have there one from there and generally we include at least one [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein German Apfelweine], the rest depends what interesting samples we get. From the point of view of style of production we are selecting mostly the more "complex" "natural ciders" made from cider apples, if possible without any additives, unfiltered and secondary fermented in the bottle (prise de mousse naturelle). That would be the highest end. It is however hard to make whole tasting in quality like this so we also get small scale bio/organic production. These are good quality ciders which may be for example filtered, some enzymes added, sulfur etc. We generally include one classic big scale commercial cider for comparison. To increase a bit of spectrum of what can be done we like to have some flavoured ciders, like raspberry cider, honey cider etc. We do like to include one or two [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poir%C3%A9 poirés (perry)] into the selection. It happens quite often that it is the first poiré which people had in their life and if you are not in the region or you don't have next to you really good alcohol shop it is really hard to get a high quality one. To finish the tasting we have at least one or two cider related products like pommeau, calvados or vinegar.

'''Style'''
This tasting workshop is based on "donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds" creed. However please keep in mind that samples and ingredients for this event will be around 150-200 eu and ending up in a decent plus would help covering costs related to my, [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]], presence at this event. This is a guided tasting. During the presentation we talk about the cider in general as mentioned above. At the beginning of the tasting it is explained how to taste and evaluate the product properly. We talk about the proper shape of glasses, temperature of serving, preparing the pallet and so on. We discuss also the colour, difference of astringency, bitterness and acidity, levels of sparkliness and more. Concerning the products we start with the extra-bruts and we go in the direction of increasing sweetness towards bruts, demi-secs and douce. We try to make a list of ciders which we taste at the event with the contact details so you can get them if you like. At the end of the event we offer [https://cidreriejara.com/wiki/Main_Page Cidrerie Jara's ciders] and other products for sale for suggested donation in a legal manner so you can get a receipt, the taxes are paid. However we are trying to avoid "commercialization" of the CCC events, so it is rather about getting a bottle or two and buying more later on through delivery, inviting us to do cider tasting at your place or getting stock of bottles stocked for your local hackerspace. Part of the funds which we got from this event goes to fhb and the larger part to [[User:Algoldor|Algoldor]] covering costs for participation and also using it for fermentation projects and day to day life expenses.


'''Most Frequent Candidates'''
Here you can find some basic tips for nice ciders which I either liked or are introduced at the tastings. Not all of them are always "on" but several of them are core members. It changes of course with time to reflect the seasonality and the specificity of the product.

        <abstract>The traditional cheese tasting! - Session 1</abstract>
        <description>[To secure spot on the Session I. (Day 1, SAT 20h30) please sign in here](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheese1_39c3/)

[To secure spot on the Session 2. (Day 3, MON 20h30) please sign in here.](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheese2_39c3/)

Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds.

So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!

&#13;
The 39C3 LED badge contains 42 LEDs that blink under control of of a pre-programmed 4 cent microcontroller. When the badge is alone, the LEDs will blink randomly. When it is among friends (when there are other badges nearby), it will display a chaser pattern. &#13;
&#13;
In this workshop you will learn how to solder Surface Mounted Devices using a normal soldering iron.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for beginners. Under 16s only with responsible adult supervision.</abstract>
        <description>### 39C3 LED badge -- SMD for Beginners

![39C3 LED badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/b/7dccaedbb7ec/39C3badge.png)

Surface Mounted Devices (SMDs) are small compared to Through Hole (TH) electronic components, and have the reputation of being difficult to work with as a hobyist: Difficult to see and handle, when you sneeze, you loose them and you can not easily use them on 2.54mm raster prototyping boards.

SMD components are designed to be used in a reflow soldering process where tiny dots of solder paste are applied to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), after which the SMD components are "Picked and Placed" on the PCB, after which the whole PCB is heated to the melting point of the solder ("reflowing"), actually completing the  electrical connections.

This workshop is aimed at showing you that the reputation of being difficult to work with is a bit undeserved, and that you can also work with SMDs using just a  regular soldering iron: With some simple tricks and a suitable selection of components (not the smallest possible), the vast majority of people can successfully complete this project.

Being able to solder SMD projects using just a simple soldering iron will also help you develop some skills that are useful if you  need to do "rework" on reflow soldering projects. Reflow soldering is also not difficult to do as a hobbyist, but requires a few more tools like a stencil to apply solder paste and either an oven or a hot plate to do the reflowing. It is, however, much quicker than soldering the parts one by one, and can yield more professional looking, cleaner, solder joints.

The project is an electronic name-badge - You should write your name (or nick) on it and wear it. It contains 42 LEDs, a microcontroller, some support components and an InfraRed transmitter and receiver that allow it to communicate with other badges. When the badge detects the presence of other badges ("friends") nearby, it will change its behaviour. It will not only interact with other 39C3 LED badges, but also with TBD badges - come visit the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp

### Costs
This workshop is donation based. Materials costs are 2 euro per badge. Donations will go towards 1) covering costs of the badges, 2) covering costs of running the hardware hacking area in general, 3) covering costs of organizing TBD (see the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp)

### Registration
The number of participants per session is limited. First come, first served. Either get a participation voucher beforehand or show up early (there may be places left).
There will be *numbered* paper vouchers available for each session some time in advance of each session. If you get a voucher and do not show up *before* the designated starting time, someone else may take your spot. Please don't take multiple vouchers and don't take  vouchers if you don't actually plan to participate.

### Getting a kit
Kits are part of the workshop and not for sale separately. You can, however easily source your own PCBs and parts and make kits yourself because the design is  MIT licensed open source.

        <description>**AI-tiny Blinkeshit3000 (SMD reflow for beginners)**

**Materials costs**:  €25 - €40

**Taught by**: Swiss Mechatronic Art Society.

**Device**: The Blinken3000 device is based on an ATTiny85 and 4x5 RGB LEDs and - thanks to a custom ATmel booloader - can be programmed via an 3.5mm audio jack.

**Workshop Itinerary**:  Using a self-etched PCB and lots of LEDs, you get the chance to play pick &amp; place machine, before putting your device into the reflow oven to take care of the soldering magic.

Afterwards, it's all about using AI to create fancy colour patterns and experimenting with different kinds of diffusors for sparkling light effects.

No soldering skills required. Some fine motoric skills needed for placing the components onto the PCB.

No programming skills required, as we let AI do the heavy software lifting.

**Materials costs**:  
€25

**Taught by** fablab|nk.

**Workshop Itinerary**:  
Choose to build one of two badge-kits: a drawable-reusable LED convention badge (1 hour, beginner skill level) or a beam-catching light-to-sound synthesiser badge (2 hours, intermediate skill level)

About the SynthLab “Beam-Catcher” Badge:
A special-edition light-to-sound synthesiser badge based on Dylan B's open-source Beam Catcher project. Wave a DIY photoresistive probe over 6 tunable LED’s to amplify light frequencies and create your own drone-tones. ‘Break-out’ your badge and power it with a 9V battery or leave it intact and use it as your first Eurorack synth module (see it in action in our DIY rack at our assembly!). This project comes out of our weekly SynthLab audio hardware meetups at fablab|nk and is designed to be a first-introduction kit to DIY synthesiser building for new visitors :)

About the Mechmon Drawable Convention Badge:
Create your own unique, reusable convention badge! This fun hands-on project lets you solder a 555-timer based LED badge that blinks and shows off your style. The screenprinted avatar area can be drawn on with a whiteboard marker, then easily erased to design new faces or characters again and again. Perfect for makers and convention-goers alike, this workshop combines creativity, electronics, and personalization—so you can stand out with a badge that’s truly one of a kind at 39C3 and your next event

        <description>We print with building block tiles, also known as Lego Dots™, on paper.
There will be a short introduction to the printing technique and how to create the printing plates.
We print using the primary colors and can mix any other color as needed.

What makes Lego Dots™ exciting is that you are bound to a grid – in this case, 8×8 units. The tiles come in different shapes: circles, squares, quarter circles, and many more. Have a look at the gallery to see some examples.

We print using a press from the Open Press Project.
The print size is limited to 7×7 cm due to the press we are using.
It is a “jump-in” workshop with no registration required – when one person leaves, the next can join in.

        <abstract>Workshop with Anna Maria &amp; Michelle Tylicki&#13;
&#13;
DAY 1: 18:00 - 19:30&#13;
DAY 2: 17:30 - 19:00&#13;
DAY 3: 20:30 - 22:00</abstract>
        <description>Facial recognition systems are rapidly advancing - fusing infrared, facial geometry, gait, and metadata into oppressive infrastructures of racist policing and surveillance capitalism. At the same time, artists, activists and everyday citizens are developing creative ways to interfere, confuse, and disappear from automated identification.

Workshop 1: Break Your Face
Hands-on demonstration of Dazzle anti-surveillance makeup techniques. Live-testing our work to understand machine vision -and how to break it.

Workshop 2 + 3: Zine-making
Starting with a discussion of creative anti-surveillance tactics, we then combine the workshop participants' knowledge and experience to co-creating a zine.

Info: We will be using easily available live face filters on smart phones (instagram/snapchat/tiktok). Participants can use their own phones. The data is not uploaded or saved anywhere.

        <description>In this workshop, we will engage with digital publishing methods that operate independently of big tech platforms and products. We will build our own RSS files for personal websites, blogs and discuss pirate publishing forms, both online and offline.

We will present the idea of the PPDP-PRINTER, a DIY device currently under development that combines web2print scripts with a simple server and local online publishing/broadcasting capabilities. The printer converts files, prints via its dot-matrix printer, creates RSS feeds, and serves them online. Our aim with the PPDP-PRINTER is to create an all-in-one material manifestation of our resource collection Post-Platform Digital Publishing Toolkit

        <description>In the workshop, we discover motifs that genAIs tend to overlook: marine flora and fauna. On top of that, we will try to find out what these might look like in 10 years' time, under both utopian and dystopian conditions. We will work with image and video generators.

        <description>If the shit hits the fan, medical first aid can often prevent the situation to get worse. Psychological first aid (PFA) can too. Unfortunately, PFA is not (yet) taught in schools or as an obligatory part of driver's license. With this crash course, we want to pass on evidence-based knowledge about the basics of psychological first aid, as we apply it in our work at CADUS. This is not about therapy, but about initial, relatively simple, almost technical measures to help our brain, our body, our psyche process what we have experienced - for self-protection and to help others.

        <abstract>In diesem Workshop könnt ihr humanitäre Einsatzkleidung von Plattenträger bis CBRN-Schutzanzug selbst anprobieren, erfahren, wovor sie schützt (und wovor nicht), wie anstrengend sie im Gebrauch ist und warum wir sie im Einsatz nutzen.</abstract>
        <description>What does operational gear actually feel like? With us, you can try it on and find out: plate carrier, helmet, ballistic goggles, IFAK — and in the second part, a full CBRN protective suit with mask. We’ll give a short introduction to why we use this equipment in humanitarian missions and what it can realistically do.

You’ll be able to try everything on yourself, ask questions, and get a real sense of what this gear protects you from — and what it doesn’t — as well as how exhausting it is to put on and move around in. Photos are absolutely fine, whether it’s for your grandma’s Christmas card or just for fun.

Please note: This workshop includes discussion of war, injury, and death.

        <abstract>Entdecke das wahrscheinlich lustigste Instrument der Welt, die Nasenflöte! Nach einer kurzen Einführung übt jede*r in eigenem Tempo die ersten Töne. Klappt das Tröten, geht’s weiter mit einfachen Melodien – und schließlich spielen wir gemeinsam als Nasenflöten-Orchester beliebte Songs und Wunschmelodien.  Lustig, überraschend, musikalisch – und garantiert einmalig!</abstract>
        <description>Welcome to what is probably the world's only orchestra where the most important sound-producing instrument is... your nose! Each participant receives a fresh nose flute and easy-to-understand instructions on how to correctly position, breathe, and blow this wondrous instrument.  Then it's time to learn by sniffing! Everyone practices at their own pace how to conjure up individual notes cleanly from their nose—from a delicate peep to a confident TOOT.  Once everyone has got the hang of it (and the first tears of laughter have dried), we venture into simple sequences of notes that already sound suspiciously like music. And if that works well, it gets really epic: We transform ourselves into a nose flute a cappella orchestra, where everyone can suggest melodies – from children's songs to epic film themes. Together, we make the air vibrate!  In short: A workshop full of fun, tooting noises, unexpected talents – and real music from the nose.

        <description>CADUS is currently active in war zones such as Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan—but it all started backstage at a music festival.
The idea: to rethink humanitarian aid, beyond uniforms, hierarchy, and postcolonial “white charity” logic. Instead, sharing skills, hacking tools, and making knowledge openly accessible—disaster relief as a commons. In this talk, we'll share how a DIY project from the subculture has evolved into an organization that now builds medical infrastructure, tech solutions, and training in crisis areas—with bright minds from different disciplines, open-source hardware, and a lot of improvisation.
We talk about what it means to de-elitize humanitarian work: How can we act in conflicts, climate disasters, or collapses without slipping into old power logics? How can practical solidarity be scaled without becoming an NGO apparatus? And what can nerds, makers, and activists contribute in concrete terms when the world is burning? A reality check with hopefully contagious energy for action—from the idea to the reality of deployment. No hero stories, but many lessons learned and open construction sites.
Especially with regard to Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, and the climate crisis, we want to show that the ability to act is not a question of profession, uniform, or mandate—but of collective creativity, technical openness, and solidarity-based courage.

        <abstract>Rückblick auf bisher durchgeführte Veranstaltungen und gemeinsamer Ausblick auf kommende Veranstaltungen.</abstract>
        <description>Im Jahr 2024 konnten wir den 75. Geburtstag des Grundgesetzes feiern. Anlass genug, um mit “Wiki Loves Demokratie” eine Reihe von Veranstaltungen ins Leben zu rufen, die dazu beitragen will, zum Begriff der Demokratie selbst und zur freiheitlich demokratischen Grundordnung Artikel in der Wikipedia weiter anzureichern und so diese wichtigen Themen noch sichtbarer zu machen. In der Session wollen wir auf die durchgeführten Veranstaltungen zurückblicken und gemeinsam weitere Ideen und Wünsche für zukünftige Veranstaltungen zu “Wiki Loves Demokratie” zusammentragen und sammeln. Wir freuen uns auf den Austausch mit euch!

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>The WIkidata Query Service (WDQS) is one of the main services to get data from Wikidata. In this workshop we'll explore the SPARQL query language that allows us to access data as well as the WDQS UI, a helpful UI in which we can write and run queries. The goal is that you'll be able to write your own queries and explore Wikidata's data by the end of the session.</abstract>

        <description>At the beginning of December, the European Court of Justice ruled that online marketplaces are liable for data protection violations committed by their users, regardless of whether they took timely action against them. The liability privilege for hosting providers does not apply to violations of the GDPR. Online marketplaces and their users are jointly responsible. Providers are therefore required to verify the identity of users and their content in advance. Does this spell the end for the Fediverse? We take a look at the ruling together and discuss what it means for instance operators in the Fediverse.

        <abstract>Content warning! Expect a rather ‘erotic’ reading of stories based on extracts of our research, brewed by a quirky mind.</abstract>
        <description>This is a reading of some red-tape-diary stories, based on FediVariety’s deep package inspection on the EDPS’s ‘EU Voice/Video’ pilot project—but with a juicy twist! Every character is real, each event actually happened, and all quotes are genuine. However, all of this will be ridiculously tweaked.

Views are very personal, none of the involved (EU) organisations or individuals accept any liability for damage of any kind resulting from the risks inherent in the erotic transmission of messages.

        <description>Make light sound or mechanical circuits. The electronic building blocks from OEM Dbolo are not only especially child-friendly due to their simple push-button connections but also a lot of fun for all ages. They are distributed by various brands, including "Kosmos Easy" and "Elenco Snap Circuits." No prior knowledge of electricity is required, but beware - learning something might happen! This is an open parent-child activity. Learn, build, and play together, and take care for arguments and that the parts don’t fall on the floor. Teenagers and adults are also welcome without child accompaniment. ;-)

        <abstract>Bei uns kannst Du sehr einfach Deiner ePA widersprechen. Hierfür haben wir für Dich ein Formular vorbereitet, dass Du ausfüllst, wir schicken das dann an Deine Krankenkasse. &#13;
Das geht auch außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten", komm einfach jederzeit vorbei, auch wenn wir nicht da sind liegt eine Anleitung aus wie das funktioniert.&#13;
Darüber hinaus bieten wir noch andere Widersprüche und Auskünfte an.</abstract>
        <description>Als gesetzlich Versicherter hast Du Anfang 2025 eine ePA erhalten, in der fortan alle Deine Behandlungsdaten (Diagnosen, Medikamente, Zahnbehandlungen, ...) protokolliert werden. Wir raten zum Widerspruch und helfen gerne dabei und stehen für Fragen zur Verfügung.

Darüber hinaus bieten wir Widerspruchsformulare gegen das Durchsuchen Deiner Abrechnungsdaten durch die Krankenkassen an. Damit will die Krankenkasse auf Basis Deiner persönlichen Daten ein sog. Risikoprofil für Dich erstellen.

Außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten" findest Du an unserem Stand eine Anleitung, die Dir zeigt wie Du Deiner ePA widersprechen kannst.

Alternativ kannst Du auch unseren Widerspruchsgenerator dafür nutzen, den Du auf unserer Webseite 'https://widerspruch-epa.de' findest.

Zusätzlich kannst Du auch eine Auskunft bei Deiner Krankenasse zu allen dort vorliegenden Daten von Dir machen.

        <abstract>In this talk, I will describe how my team and I systematically exploited around a dozen home-rolled network encryption protocols used by popular mobile apps like RedNote, Alipay, and some of the most popular mobile browsers in China to encrypt sensitive information. I'll demonstrate how network eavesdroppers could access users' browsing history and mobile activity.&#13;
&#13;
This is a systemic issue; despite our work on the above protocols and the resulting vulnerability disclosures, this plague of home-rolled and proprietary encryption is still at large. I will end by discussing how we got here, re-affirm the age-old adage, “Don’t roll your own crypto!”, and call on hackers around the world to help us move towards HTTPS everywhere in understudied app ecosystems.</abstract>
        <description>TLS is not as universal as we might think. Applications with hundreds of millions of active users continue to use insecure, home-rolled proprietary network encryption to protect sensitive user data. This talk demonstrates that this is a widespread and systemic issue affecting a large portion of the most popular applications in the world. These issues are particularly concentrated in mobile applications developed in China, which have been overlooked by the global security community despite their massive popularity and influence.

To study this problem, I designed and implemented WireWatch, a pipeline to evaluate the network security of Android apps, for my PhD thesis dissertation. WireWatch measures apps’ usage of plaintext network traffic and non-standard, proprietary network cryptography. We found that 47.6% of top Mi Store applications used proprietary network cryptography without any additional encryption, compared to only 3.51% of top Google Play Store applications. We analyzed a variety of protocols from WireWatch, including cryptosystems designed by Alibaba, iQIYI, Kuaishou, and Tencent. Of the top 9 protocol families, we discovered vulnerabilities in 8 that allowed network eavesdroppers to decrypt underlying data. We also discovered additional vulnerabilities in several other protocols used by apps with hundreds of millions of users.

Through the vulnerabilities fixed as a result of this work, this research has directly improved the network security of up to one billion people. However, there were hundreds more proprietary protocols used by popular applications that we discovered. Verifying all of their security through manual reverse-engineering and vulnerability reporting is not feasible at this scale. What can we do as a community to fix this systemic issue and prevent such failures from occurring in the future?

        <abstract>We present a comprehensive security assessment of Unitree's robotic ecosystem. We identified and exploited multiple security flaws across multiple communication channels, including Bluetooth, LoRa radio, WebRTC, and cloud management services. Besides pwning multiple traditional binary or web vulnerabilities, we also exploit the embodied AI agent in the robots, performing prompt injection and achieve root-level remote code execution. Furthermore, we leverage a flaw in cloud management services to take over any Unitree G1 robot connected to the Internet. By deobfuscating and patching the customized, VM-based obfuscated binaries, we successfully unlocked forbidden robotic movements restricted by the vendor firmware on consumer models such as the G1 AIR. We hope our findings could offer a roadmap for manufacturers to strengthen robotic designs, while arming researchers and consumers with critical knowledge to assess security in next-generation robotic systems.</abstract>
        <description>Unitree is among the highest-volume makers of commercial robots, and their newest humanoid platforms ship with multiple control stacks and on-device AI agents. If the widespread, intrusive presence of these robots in our lives is inevitable, should we take the initiative to ensure they are completely under our control? What paths might attackers use to compromise these robots, and to what extent could they threaten the physical world?

In this talk, we first map the complete attack surface of Unitree humanoids, covering hardware interfaces, near-field radios and Internet-accessible channels. We demonstrate how a local attacker can hijack a robot by exploiting vulnerabilities in short-range radio communications (Bluetooth, LoRa) and local Wi-Fi. We also present a fun exploit of the embodied AI in the humanoid: With a single spoken/text sentence, we jailbreak the on-device LLM Agent and pivot to root-priviledged remote code execution. Combined with a flaw in the cloud management service, this forms a full path to gain complete control over any Unitree robot connected to the Internet, obtaining root shell, camera livestreaming, and speaker control.

To achieve this, we combined hardware inspection, firmware extraction, software-defined radio tooling, and deobfuscation of customized, VM-based protected binaries. This reverse engineering breakthrough also allowed us to understand the overall control logic, patch decision points, and unlock advanced robotic movements that were deliberately disabled on consumer models like G1 AIR.

Takeaways. Modern humanoids are networked, AI-powered cyber-physical systems; weaknesses across radios, cloud services, and on-device agents could allow attackers to remotely hijack robot operations, extract sensitive data or camera livestreams, or even weaponize the physical capabilities. As robotics continue their transition from controlled environments to everyday applications, our work highlights the urgent need for security-by-design in this emerging technology landscape.

        <abstract>Trump has staged an unscheduled, midair rapid disassembly of the global system of trade. Ironically, it is this system that prevented all of America's trading partners from disenshittifying their internet: the US trade representative threatened the world with tariffs unless they passed laws that criminalized reverse-engineering and modding. By banning "adversarial interoperability," America handcuffed the world's technologists, banning them from creating the mods, hacks, alt clients, scrapers, and other tools needed to liberate their neighbours from the enshittificatory predations of the ketamine-addled zuckermuskian tyrants of US Big Tech.&#13;
&#13;
Well, when life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. The Trump tariffs are here, and it's time to pick the locks on the those handcuffs and set the world's hackers loose on Big Tech. Happy Liberation Day, everyone!</abstract>
        <description>Enshittification wasn't an accident. It also wasn't inevitable. This isn't the iron laws of economics at work, nor is it the great forces of history.

Enshittification was a choice: named individuals, in living memory, enacted policies that created the enshittogenic environment. They created a world that encouraged tech companies to merge to monopoly, transforming the internet into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four." They let these monopolists rip us off and spy on us.

And they banned us from fighting back, claiming that anyone who modified a technology without permission from its maker was a pirate (or worse, a terrorist). They created a system of "felony contempt of business-model," where it's literally a crime to change how your own devices work. They declared war on the general-purpose computer and demanded a computer that would do what the manufacturer told it to do (even if the owner of the computer didn't want that).

We are at a turning point in the decades-long war on general-purpose computing. Geopolitics are up for grabs. The future is ours to seize.

In my 24 years with EFF, I have seen many strange moments, but never one quite like this. There's plenty of terrifying things going on right now, but there's also a massive, amazing, incredibly opportunity to seize the means of computation.

Let's take it. '

        <abstract>In this talk, we will give an introduction into the project (i.e. how it all started at 38c3 and why we are here now), provide an in-depth review of how the development process of our pager worked and what our future goals are.&#13;
&#13;
In our introduction, we will talk about the origin and exploration phase of the inital pager idea (i.e. how we went from the idea of bringing POCSAG Pager transmitter to 38c3, over a cable-bound prototype, to a first working pager on a proper PCB). We will also present our plans of connecting our POCSAG transmitter infrastructure to THOT (CERTs own dispatch software).&#13;
&#13;
For our in-depth review about the project, we explain how we encountered major reception problems, how we analyzed them at easterhegg22 and conducted experiments there, and why we are opting for a custom HF frontend design instead of an already-made one from chinese vendors. Moreover, we provide an overview of our transmitter devices and give some advice on how to replicate those.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, we will discuss further challenges and what our next goals are.&#13;
&#13;
If we are reaching our milestone until 39c3, we will also give a live demo of the system.</abstract>
        <description>At 38c3, we conducted an experiment to test out our self-built POCSAG Pager infrastructure. Together with DL0TUH and CERT, we are now working on an open pager solution leveraging well-known components in the maker commmunity (e.g. ESP32, SX1262) to support the alarming of action forces at c3 events. In this talk, we will guide you through the process of developing such a project, problems that are occuring and what our future plans are.

        <abstract>This talk presents Apple's link-layer protocol Low-Latency WiFi and how it achieves its real-time capabilities to enable Continuity features like Sidecar Display and Continuity Camera. We make more kernel logging available on iOS and build a log aggregator that combines and aligns system- and network-level log sources from iOS and macOS.</abstract>
        <description>Apple's Continuity features make up a big part of their walled garden. From AirDrop and Handoff to AirPlay, they all connect macOS and iOS devices wirelessly. In recent years, security researchers have opened up several of these features showing that the Apple ecosystem is technically compatible with third-party devices.

In this talk, we present the internal workings of Low-Latency WiFi (LLW) – Apple's link-layer protocol for several real-time Continuity features like Continuity Camera and Sidecar Display. We talk about the concepts behind LLW, how it achieves its low-latency requirement and how we got there in the reverse engineering process.

We also present the tooling we built to enable more kernel-level tracing and logging on iOS through a reimplementation of cctool from macOS and the source code of trace that was buried deep inside of Apple’s open-source repository system_cmds. We build a log aggregator that combines various kernel- and user-space traces, log messages and pcap files from both iOS and macOS into a single file and finally investigate the network stack on Apple platforms that is implemented in both user- and kernel space. There we find interesting configuration values of LLW that make it the go-to link-layer protocol for Apple's proprietary real-time Continuity applications.

        <description>2025 war ein gutes Jahr für Exploits, kein gutes Jahr für die Freiheit und ein herausragendes für schlechte Ideen. Regierungen kämpften weiter für Massenüberwachung, natürlich mit KI-Unterstützung™. Kriege wurden weiter „digitalisiert“, Chatkontrolle als Kinderschutz verkauft, Waffensysteme haben inzwischen mehr Autonomie als die meisten Bürger*innen und künstliche Intelligenz löst endlich alle Probleme – vor allem die, die bisher niemand hatte.

        <abstract>Why is electronics manufacturing hard? Can it ever be made easy and more accessible? What will it take to relocate industrial production to Europe?&#13;
&#13;
We share with you what we learned when we spent more than 1 year setting up our own production line in our office in Hamburg. Turns out a lot of the difficulties are rarely talked about or hidden behind "manufacturing is high CAPEX". &#13;
&#13;
Come and learn with us the nitty gritty details of batch reflow ovens, stencil printing at scale, and how OpenPnP is a key enabler in our process. While we are far from done with this work, we hope to see others replicate it and collectively reclaim the ownership of the means of electronics production.</abstract>
        <description>Our industry needs a reboot as well, it no longer serves the people.

Our work is based on our belief that high-quality high-mix/low volume manufacturing of electronics in Europe is economically viable and accessible to small companies with a lower-than-expected up-front investment.

We believe that relocation of industry to Europe depends on small innovative companies, and will not come from slow and bloated industry giants whose products are victims of enshittification and maximum profit extraction.

By using open-source hardware and software whenever possible, we are attempting to set up our own production operation in Hamburg and we want to share the solutions and enable others to do the same and collectively reclaim ownership of the means of production.

We will cover:
- How we acquired and set up production machines, their costs, and our learnings
- Quirks of paste printing and reflow soldering at scale (up to 50 batches a day)
- Component inventory, tracking, DfM, etc.
- How OpenPnP is a key enabler of our prcesses
    - Our proposed changes to OpenPnP
    - Our work integrated Siemens Siplace Feeders in OpenPnP

        <abstract>"freiheit.exe“ ist eine Lecture über die ideologischen Rootkits des Silicon Valley. Sie schlägt den Bogen von den italienischen Futuristen zu den heutigen Tech-Feudalisten, vom Akzelerationismus zur Demokratieskepsis der Libertären, von Tolkien zur PayPal-Mafia. &#13;
Basierend auf den Recherchen zu meinem Theaterstück "freiheit.exe. Utopien als Malware", in dem  journalistische Analyse auf performative Darstellung trifft.</abstract>
        <description>Ich lade das CCC-Publikum ein, die Betriebssysteme hinter unseren Betriebssystemen zu untersuchen.
Während wir uns mit Verschlüsselung, Datenschutz und digitaler Selbstbestimmung beschäftigen, installieren Tech-Milliardäre ihre Weltanschauungen als Default-Einstellungen unserer digitalen Infrastruktur. Die Recherchen beleuchten die mitgelieferte Malware.

Ich navigiere durch die Ideengeschichte zwischen Marinettis Futuristischem Manifest (1909) und Musks Mars-Kolonien, von den ersten Programmiererinnen zur Eroberung des Alls, von neoliberalen Think Tanks zur Schuldenbremse, von nationalen Christen zu Pronatalisten.
Investigative Recherche trifft auf performative Vermittlung. 
Mit O-Tönen von Peter Thiel, Nick Land und anderen zeigt die Lecture ideologische Verbindungslinien zwischen Theoretikern autoritär-technoider Träume und den Visionen der Tech-Oligarchen auf:

Es geht um „Freedom Cities“, Steuerflucht und White Supremacy.
Um Transhumanismus als Upgrade-Zwang bis hin zu neo-eugenischen Gedanken.
Um Akzeleration als politische Strategie: Geschwindigkeit statt Reflexion, Disruption statt Demokratie, Kolonisierung – jetzt auch digital.

Aus Theaterperspektive betrachte ich das Revival der Cäsaren und die Selbstinszenierung von Tech-CEOs als Künstler, Priester oder Genies. 
Und mit der Investigativ Reporterin Sylke Grunwald habe ich recherchiert, was all das mit den Debatten rund um Palantir zu tun hat.

Die scheinbar alternativlose Logik von "Move Fast and Break Things" ist nicht unvermeidlich – sie ist gewollt, gestaltet, ideologisch aufgeladen.

        <abstract>Was passiert, wenn staatliche Domains auslaufen - und plötzlich jemand anderes sie besitzt?&#13;
In diesem Vortrag wird berichtet, wie mehrere ehemals offizielle, aber unregistrierte Domains deutscher Bundesministerien und Behörden erworben werden konnten - und welche Datenströme dadurch sichtbar wurden. Über Monate hinweg konnten so DNS-Anfragen aus Netzen des Bundes empfangen werden - ein erhebliches Sicherheitsrisiko. Unter anderem da es so möglich war Accounts zu übernehmen, Validierungen von E-Mailsignaturen zu manipulieren, Anfrage umzuleiten und im Extremfall Code auf Systemen auszuführen.&#13;
(Keine sensiblen Daten werden veröffentlicht; der Fokus liegt auf Forschung, Aufklärung und verantwortungsvollem Umgang mit den Ergebnissen.)</abstract>
        <description>Im Rahmen der Untersuchung zeigten sich nicht nur Fehlkonfigurationen, sondern auch Phänomene wie Bitsquatting und Typoquatting innerhalb der Verwaltungsnetze. Mit dem Betrieb eines DNS-Servers und dem Erwerb von bund.ee (naher Typosquatting/Bitquatting zu bund.de) konnten u.a. zahlreiche DNS-Anfragen von Servern des Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI) und weiterer Einrichtungen des Bundes empfangen werden.

Der Vortrag beleuchtet die technischen und organisatorischen Schwachstellen, die hinter solchen Vorgängen stehen - und zeigt, wie DNS-Details Einblicke in die IT-Infrastruktur des Staates ermöglichen können. Abgerundet wird das Ganze durch praktische Beispiele, Datenanalysen und Empfehlungen, wie sich ähnliche Vorfälle künftig vermeiden lassen.

In anderen Ländern sind gov-Domains als TLDs längst üblich (bspw. gov.uk) - in Deutschland ist bund.de oder gov.de allerdings nicht so verbreitet wie man glaubt, unter anderem da Bundesministerien eigene Domains nutzen oder nach Regierungsbildung umbenannt werden.

        <abstract>We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and examined all of the geostationary satellite communications visible from our vantage point. A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government communications, private citizens’ voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and mobile networks.</abstract>
        <description>In this talk, we will cover our hardware setup, alignment techniques, our parsing code, and survey some of the surprising finds in the data.  This talk will include some previously unannounced results.  This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of the surface of the earth.

        <abstract>Xous is a message-passing microkernel implemented in pure Rust, targeting secure embedded applications. This talk covers three novel aspects of the OS: hardware MMU support (and why we had to make our own chip to get this feature), how and why we implemented the Rust standard library in Rust (instead of calling the C standard library, like most other Rust platforms), and how we combine the power of Rust semantics with virtual memory to create safe yet efficient asynchronous messaging primitives. We conclude with a short demo of the OS running on a new chip, the "Baochip-1x", which is an affordable, mostly-open RTL SoC built in 22nm TSMC, configured expressly for running Xous.</abstract>
        <description>The world is full of small, Internet-of-Things (IoT) gadgets running embedded operating systems. These devices generally fall into two categories: larger devices running a full operating system using an MMU which generally means Linux, or smaller devices running without an MMU using operating systems like Zephyr, chibios, or rt-thread, or run with no operating system at all. The software that underpins these projects is written in C with coarse hardware memory protection at best. As a result, these embedded OSes lack the security guarantees and/or ergonomics offered by modern languages and best practices.

The Xous microkernel borrows concepts from heavier operating systems to modernize the embedded space. The open source OS is written in pure Rust with minimal dependencies and an emphasis on modularity and simplicity, such that a technically-savvy individual can audit the code base in a reasonable period of time. This talk covers three novel aspects of the OS: its incorporation of hardware memory virtualization, its pure-Rust standard library, and its message passing architecture.

Desktop OSes such as Linux require a hardware MMU to virtualize memory. We explain how ARM has tricked us into accepting that MMUs are hardware-intensive features only to be found on more expensive “application” CPUs, thus creating a vicious cycle where cheaper devices are forced to be less safe. Thanks to the open nature of RISC-V, we are able to break ARM’s yoke and incorporate well-established MMU-based memory protection into embedded hardware, giving us security-first features such as process isolation and encrypted swap memory. In order to make Xous on real hardware more accessible, we introduce the Baochip-1x, an affordable, mostly-open RTL 22nm SoC configured expressly for the purpose of running Xous. The Baochip-1x features a Vexriscv CPU running at 400MHz, 2MiB of SRAM, 4MiB of nonvolatile RRAM, and a quad-core RV32E-derivative I/O accelerator called the “BIO”, based on the PicoRV clocked at 800MHz.

Most Rust targets delegate crucial tasks such as memory allocation, networking, and threading to the underlying operating system’s C standard library. We want strong memory safety guarantees all the way down to the memory allocator and task scheduler, so for Xous we implemented our standard library in pure Rust. Adhering to pure Rust also makes cross-compilation and cross-platform development a breeze, since there are no special compiler or linker concerns. We will show you how to raise the standard for “Pure Rust” by implementing a custom libstd.

Xous combines the power of page-based virtual memory and Rust’s strong borrow-checker semantics to create a safe and efficient method for asynchronous message passing between processes. This inter-process communication model allows for easy separation of different tasks while keeping the core kernel small. This process maps well onto the Rust "Borrow / Mutable Borrow / Move" concept and treats object passing as an IPC primitive. We will demonstrate how this works natively and give examples of how to map common programming algorithms to shuttle data safely between processes, as well as give examples of how we implement features such as scheduling and synchronization primitive entirely in user space.

We conclude with a short demo of Xous running on the Baochip-1x, bringing Xous from the realm of emulation and FPGAs into everyday-user accessible physical silicon.

        <abstract>Join bleeptrack for a deep dive into the fascinating world of procedural generation beyond the screen. From stickers and paper lanterns to PCBs, furniture, and even physical procedural generators, this talk explores the challenges and creative possibilities of bringing generative projects into tangible form.</abstract>
        <description>In this talk, I will share practical insights from developing procedural generation tools for physical objects: ranging from stickers and paper lanterns to printed circuit boards and even furniture. I will outline key challenges and considerations when generating designs for fabrication tools such as laser cutters or pen plotters, as well as how to adapt procedural systems so they can be reproduced by a wide audience (not everyone has access to CNC machines or industrial equipment, sadly!).

Beyond technical considerations, I aim to encourage attendees to translate their own generative ideas into tangible artifacts and to foster a culture of open-sourcing and knowledge sharing within the community.

Maschinen dringen immer mehr in den menschlichen Diskurs ein. Wir wollen das nicht länger hinnehmen und drehen den Spieß um.</abstract>
        <description>In unserem Reverse-Turing-Test schlüpfen die Teilnehmenden in die Rolle einer KI und versuchen so robotisch-menschlich wie möglich zu klingen. In einer anschließenden Blindstudie prüfen wir, wer sich am besten unter KIs mischen und beim nächsten Robot Uprising die Spionin der Wahl wäre.

Humor, Kreativität und ein Hang zu allgemeingültigen, nichtssagenden Floskeln sind die perfekten Voraussetzungen! Ein digitales Endgerät (Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop, …) reicht zum Mitspielen aus.

        <title>Hatupangwingwi: The story how Kenyans fought back against intrusive digital identity systems</title>

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>The session title is fashioned after the Kenyan movement building rhetoric “Hatupangwingwi” which is Kenyan slang meant as a call to action to counter anti-movement building techniques by the political class and resist infiltration and corruption. This is true for the organisation and movement building towards inclusive identity regimes in Kenya. &#13;
The session seeks to explore the lessons from Kenya’s journey to digitalization of public services  and the uptake of Digital Public infrastructure. It digs deeper on the power of us and how civil society could stop a destructive surveillance driven digitalisation thus protecting millions of Kenyans.</abstract>
        <description>In 2019, the Kenyan government announced the transition to a centralised database named National integrated Identity management system (Huduma Namba) in a bid to develop a digital Identity system that went on to be termed a “single source of truth. Historically, Kenya has not had the best track record with civil registration and identity systems. This is particularly due to the linkages with colonial practices with the first ID “Kipande” being used as a tool for surveillance of natives and imposed for restriction of movement. This system carried on post independence creating different classes of citizens in terms of access to nationality documents. 
It is for this reason that CSOs, mostly community-based, chose a three pronged approach to counter this; seeking legal redress, grassroots/community mobilization and advocacy and spotlighting ways in which in a shrinking civil society space, Kenyan civil society was able not only take up space, but make their impact felt in protecting the rights of those on the margins. The session shares lessons of how we shaped the Media narrative that took down a multi million dollar project that was not people centered but rather oppression driven. This session shares experiences of how we created a heightened sense of citizenry awareness to shoot down oppressive digitalisation agendas. 
The aim is to show how these efforts led to over 10 million Kenyans resisting to enroll in the system especially the young people (Gen Z) who felt they were being coerced to join a system due to the poor messaging by the government and they connected with the NGO campaign thus choosing to resist the system in the true spirit of Hatupangwingwi,  with Hashtags like [#DOIDRIGHT](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/DOIDRIGHT) and [#DEPORTME](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/DEPORTME) trending on social media as a sign of resistance. This led to the collapse of the whole project.
Finally, the session will share how in 2022, when the new government wanted to roll out the new DPI project known as Maisha Namba, they realised the importance of including civil society voices and they convened over 50 NGOs to try to build buy-in for the new digital ID program. It was the first time the government and NGOs were on the same table discussing how to build an inclusive digital ID system. This is the story of how the power of us led to civil society earning their space in the designing phase of the new Digital Public Infrastructure.

        <abstract>In 2022, CitizenLab contacted a member of the Spanish non-profit Irídia to tell them that one of their members had likely been hacked with Pegasus spyware. The target, a lawyer, had been spied on by the Spanish government in 2020 because he represented a Catalan politician who was in prison. His phone was infected with Pegasus during the COVID-19 lockdown, on the same day he was having an online meeting with other lawyers working on the case.&#13;
&#13;
Irídia and the lawyer (Andreu) decided to take the case to court. A few years later, he met with Data Rights and invited them to join forces and bring in partners from across Europe to increase the impact. This collaboration led to the creation of the PEGA coalition in May 2025.&#13;
&#13;
This talk goes over the status of the case and work we have done across Europe to bring spyware use in court.</abstract>
        <description>Despite the European Parliament’s PEGA investigation in 2023, spyware scandals in Europe continue to grow, with little real action to stop or address them. Many EU countries were — or still are — clients of the world’s major spyware companies. As a result, nothing changes except the number of victims targeted by these technologies. Worst, offices or clients in the EU is useful for spyware companies' sales pitch. So, the EU is a growing hub for this ominous ecosystem! With no real political will to act, members of the PEGA investigation say the only hope for change is to take these cases to court — and that’s exactly the path we’ve chosen!

Irídia’s case is one of the flagship cases in the EU, both for its depth and for what it has achieved so far. We will review the current status and implications of the case, examining issues that range from state responsibility to the role of the spyware company behind Pegasus — in its creation, sale, and export — which maintains a strong presence within the EU.

After that, we will take a step back to look at what is happening across Europe. We will highlight the most significant cases currently moving forward, as well as some of the PEGA coalition’s strategies for driving accountability, strengthening safeguards, and ensuring remedies. The coalition’s mission goes beyond legal action — it aims to prevent the devastating impact of spyware and push for systemic change.

        <abstract>It is 1976 and the USA long stopped going to the Moon when a Soviet automatic landing station called Luna 24 descends to the Lunar surface. It touches down on 3.3 Billion year old rock formations at a place no mission has ever gone before. What exactly happened remains a mystery to this day, but the space probe managed to take a 2.3 m long drill core from the Lunar regolith, packaged the sample in a genius way and launched it for its voyage to Earth. Some days later the sample entered earths atmosphere and landed in remote Siberia and ended up in our hands more than 50 Years later. We tell the story of the sample, the people that brought it to Earth and how we analyzed it with the newest methods including µm sized high intensity X-ray beams, 30kV electron beams and LN2 cooled infrared spectrometers.</abstract>
        <description>In this talk, members of the Museum for Natural History in Berlin will present the story of a Luna 24 sample retrieved by the GDR from the USSR. The sample has been almost "lost" to time. When it fell into our hands, we started understanding its historical and scientific significance, produced specialized sample containers and initiated curation efforts of the sample while slowly understanding its history and geochemical composition.

### Luna 24 Moon Mission
What happened on the 18th &amp; 19th of August 1976 on the moon? Why was this landing site chosen and how was the sample retrieved and brought back to Earth? Which way did the scientists handle these extremely precious samples? Picture: Музей Космонавтики (CC0 1.0)

### Methods and Results
Which methods can be utilized to gather new information from such a sample without destroying it? Which storage and curation methods must be used to preserve its value for the scientists that come after us? How did advanced analytical methods like µCT, electron microscopes, µ X-ray fluorescence spectrometers and nitrogen-cooled infrared spectrometers contribute to our understanding of the sample?

Fly with us to the moon!

        <abstract>**Over the past few decades, nucleic acids have increasingly been investigated as alternative data storage media and platforms for molecular computing. This talk builds on past research and introduces another branch to the field: DNA cryptography based on random chemistry. This technology provides a platform for conceiving new security architectures that bridge the physical with the digital world.**</abstract>
        <description>Nucleic acids have been theorized as potential data storage and computation platforms since the mid-20th century. In the meantime, notable advances have been made in implementing such systems, combining academic research with industry efforts. 
After providing a general introduction to the interdisciplinary field of DNA information technology, in the second half of the talk focuses on DNA-based cryptography and security systems, in particular zooming in on the example of chemical unclonable functions (CUFs) based on randomly generated, synthetic DNA sequences. Similar to Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), these DNA-based systems contain vast random elements that cannot be reconstructed – neither algorithmically nor synthetically. Using biochemical processing, we can operate these systems in a fashion comparable to cryptographic hash functions, enabling new authentication protocols. Aside from covering the basics, we delve into the advantages, as well as the drawbacks, of DNA as a medium. Finally, we explore how CUFs could in the future be implemented as physical security architectures: For example, in anti-counterfeiting of medicines or as personal signatures for artworks. 
In a broader sense, this talk aims to inspire a reconsideration of entropy, randomness and information in the experimental sciences through a digital lens. In doing so, it provides examples of how looking at physical systems through an information perspective can unravel new synergies, applications and even security architectures.

        <abstract>*Der deutsche Buchmarkt gegen den Rest der Welt&#13;
oder auch: Enshittification des Buchmarkts und keine API für ein Halleluja*&#13;
&#13;
Es gibt unzählige wundervolle Geschichten und das Internet hat über die letzten Jahrzehnte viele großartige Autor*innen hervorgbracht. Doch Verlage haben begrenzte Kapazitäten und sind außerdem zumeist sehr konservativ in ihren Programmen. Die Lösung für beides: Selfpublishing. Neue und gewitzte, genre-übergreifende Bücher an neugierige Lesende zu bringen, könnte so einfach sein; wären da nicht Barsortimente, fehlende APIs und ein insgesamt schreckliches Ökosystem, die Indie-Autor:innen (und alle, die versuchen, auf dem deutschpsprachigen Buchmarkt irgend etwas Innovatives für Indies zu machen) das Leben schwer machen.</abstract>
        <description>Der Buchmarkt ist kaputt; das ist keine neue Erkentnis. Wir dröseln auf, an welchen Ecken es hakt und zeigen auf, wie schlimm es wirklich ist. Dabei machen wir auch ein bisschen Name &amp; Shame, denn irgendwer ist ja schuld. Wir zeigen aber auch, wo uns auf dem deutschen Markt noch fehlende APIs (im Gegensatz zum internationalen Buchmarkt) das Leben deutlich leichter machen würden.

        <abstract>What does knitting have to do with espionage? Can embroidery help your mental health? This talk shows how the skills to create textile art have enabled people to resist and to persist under oppressive regimes for centuries. And it offers ways to keep doing so.</abstract>
        <description>Working with textile mediums like yarn, thread, and floss is generally seen as a feminine hobby and as thus is usually classified as craft, not art. And crafting is something people, maybe even people usually seen as a bit boring, do in their free time to unwind. Most of us have grown up with the image of the loving grandmother knitting socks for the family, an act of care that was never considered anything special.
The patriarchal society’s tendency to underestimate anything considered feminine and, inextricably connected to this, domestic is an ongoing struggle. But being underestimated also provides a cover and with it the opportunity for subversion and resistance.
As global powers are cycling back to despotism and opression, let me take you back in time to show you how people used textile crafts to organise resistance and shape movements. Like the quilts that were designed and sewn to help enslaved people in the US escape slavery and navigate the Underground Railroad from the 1780s on, or the knitted garments that carried information about the Nazis to help resistance in occupied Europe during World War II, or the cross stitches by a prisoner of war that had Nazis unknowingly display art saying “Fuck Hitler”.
Textile crafts have been used by marginalised and disenfranchised people to protest, to organise, and to persist for centuries. This tradition found a new rise in what is now called “craftivism” and is using the internet to build bigger communities spanning the world. These communities also come together to help, often quite tangibly by creating specific items like the home-sewn masks during early Covid19. In addition, crafting has scientifically-proven benefits for one’s mental health.
Taking up the increasingly popular quote "When the world is too scary, too loud, too much: Stop consuming, start creating", this talk shows how the skills to create have enabled and will enable people to resist and to persist.

        <title>CPU Entwicklung in Factorio: Vom D-Flip-Flop bis zum eigenen Betriebssystem</title>

        <abstract>Factorio ist ein Fabriksimulationsspiel mit integriertem Logiksystem. Dies ermöglichte mir den Bau einer CPU, die unter anderem aus einer 5-stufiger Pipeline, einer Forwarding Logikeinheit, Interrupt Handling sowie einem I/O Interface besteht. Über einen selbst geschriebenen Assembler konnte ich ein eigenes Betriebssystem und Programme wie Minesweeper oder Snake integrieren. &#13;
Der Talk soll euch zeigen, wie sich klassische Computerarchitektur in einem völlig anderen technischen Kontext umsetzen lässt und wo dabei überraschend echte Probleme der CPU-Entwicklung auftreten.&#13;
Kommt mit auf die Reise: Vom Blick auf den gesamten Computer bis hinunter zu den einzelnen Logikgattern ist es nur eine Mausradbewegung entfernt!</abstract>
        <description>Factorio ist ein Spiel über Fabrikautomation - Förderbänder, Dampfmaschinen und Produktionsketten stehen im Vordergrund. Eigentlich ist das interne Logiksystem („Combinators“) gedacht für die Steuerung der Fabrik, jedoch erlaubt es auch die Entwicklung komplexer Hardware.

In diesem Vortrag erzähle ich meine Geschichte, wie ich eine vollständige RISC-V-Architektur in Factorio  rein aus Vanilla-Combinators erschaffen habe:
Die CPU arbeitet mit 32 Bit-Wörtern, verfügt über 32 General Purpose Register, 128 KB RAM/Persistent Storage, eine 5-stufige Pipeline mit Forwarding und Hazard-Handling sowie eine Logikeinheit für Branches und Interrupts. Ein Display-Controller steuert eine Konsolen-Ausgabe sowie ein Farbdisplay, während ein Keyboard-Controller Eingaben über physische In-Game-Tasten ermöglicht.

Ergänzt wird die Hardware auf der Softwareseite durch das Betriebssystem *FactOS*, das ein einfaches Filesystem sowie Systemcalls (zum Beispiel zum Drucken eines Strings im Terminal) zur Verfügung stellt.  Außerdem schränkt das Betriebssystem das ausführende User-Programm auf einen festen Bereich des RAMs ein und verhindert so direkten Zugriff auf die Hardware.

Im Talk möchte ich euch durch alle Schichten dieser Konstruktion führen:
Von den Grundlagen der Factorio-Signalphysik über CPU-Design und Pipeline-Hazards bis zur Toolchain und dem Betriebssystem. Außerdem gebe ich einen Einblick, wie die Limitierungen aber auch die Vorteile von Factorio im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Logik Simulatoren das Design einer CPU beeinflussen können. Ich runde meinen Talk mit einer Live-Demonstration des Systems ab.

Die vollständige CPU, inklusive Quellcode des Assemblers, Blueprints und Beispielprogramme, stelle ich öffentlich zur Verfügung. Dadurch kann jede interessierte Person die Architektur in Factorio laden, erweitern und eigene Software dafür entwickeln.

Es wird im Anschluss eine [Self-organized Session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/cpu-entwicklung-in-factorio-wie-benutze-ich-phds-f) geben, in der ich eine hands-on Einleitung geben werde, wie man die CPU in Factorio lädt, wie man Programme schreibt, diese assembliert und in Factorio einfügt. Auch kann man dort gerne mit mir über das Projekt quatschen, ich freue mich auf alle Beiträge und Kommentare :)

        <abstract>Amidst gloomy headlines, extreme weather, and climate anxiety, the good stories often get lost. Yet they exist - inspiring people, clever engineering, real breakthroughs. And that's exactly what we bring you – the positive power cycles of the energy transition in action. And real energy on stage.</abstract>
        <description>A committed energy activist and an award-winning solar cell researcher take you on a lively, motivating and sometimes funny journey:

- to electricity rebels from the Black Forest,
- to heat pumps that supply entire neighborhoods,
- to new solar technologies,
- to wind turbines with history,
- and to politicians who were too pessimistic.

What is already going really well? What can you emulate? Where is it worth getting involved?
We'll show you – in an easy-to-understand, cheerful way.
To stay motivated for an adventure as big as the energy transition, we need more than just facts and figures. We need momentum, optimism, and the human energy that keep the power cycles turning.
Come by! Let’s recharge together and celebrate the successes of the energy transition.

        <abstract>Textiles are everywhere, yet few of us know how they’re made. &#13;
&#13;
This talk aims to give you an overview over the complete transformation from fiber to finished textile. We'll be exploring fiber properties, spinning, and techniques like weaving, knitting, crochet, braiding, and knotting, followed by finishing methods such as dyeing, printing, and embroidery.&#13;
&#13;
You’ll learn why not only fiber but also structure matters, and how to make or hack textiles on your own without relying on fast fashion or industrial tools.</abstract>
        <description>Textiles play an integral part in our daily lives. If you’re reading this, chances are you’re wearing clothes or have some form of fabric within arm’s reach. Yet despite how common and essential textiles are, few of us know how they actually come to be. How do we go from a plant, animal, or synthetic polymer to a fully finished piece of clothing?

This talk unravels the full transformation pipeline of textiles: starting with fibers and their properties, then spinning them into yarn, turning that yarn into textiles through weaving, knitting, crochet, braiding, knotting, and other techniques, and finally finishing them through printing, embroidery, dyeing, or bleaching.
Along the way, you’ll learn why your “100% cotton” garments can feel completely different despite being made of the same fiber, how structure matters just as much as material, and what environmental impact different choices have.

Whether you want to make your own textiles, hack existing ones, or finally understand why that wool sweater you washed too hot is now tiny, this talk is a crash course in most things textile, and a reminder that you don’t need industrial machinery or fast fashion to create something on your own.

        <abstract>Generative AI models don't operate on human languages – they speak in **tokens**. Tokens are computational fragments that deconstruct language into subword units, stored in large dictionaries. These tokens encode not only language but also political ideologies, corporate interests, and cultural biases even before model training begins. Social media handles like *realdonaldtrump*, brand names like *louisvuitton*, or even *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* exist as single tokens, while other words remain fragmented. Through various artistic and adversarial experiments, we demonstrate that tokenization is a political act that determines what can be represented and how images become computable through language.</abstract>
        <description>Tokens are the fragments of words that generative models use to process language, the step that breaks text into subword units before any neural networks are involved. There are 51 ways to combine tokens to spell the word giraffe using existing vocabulary: from a single token **giraffe** to splits using multiple tokens like *gi|ra|ffe*, *gira|f|fe*, or even *g|i|r|af|fe*.

In one experiment, we hijacked the prompting process and fed token combinations directly to text-to-image models. With variations like *g|iraffe* or *gir|affe* still generating recognizable results, our experiments show that the beginning and end of tokens hold particular semantic weight in forming giraffe-like images. This reveals that certain images cannot be generated through prompting alone, as the tokenization process sanitizes most combinations, suggesting that English, or any human language, is merely a subset of token languages.

The talk features experiments using genetic algorithms to reverse-engineer prompts from images, respelling words in token language to change their generative outcomes, and critically examining token dictionaries to investigate edge cases where the vocabulary breaks down entirely, producing somewhat *speculative languages* that include strange words formed at the edge of chaos where English meets token (non-)sense.

These experiments show that even before generation occurs, token dictionaries already encode a stochastic worldview, shaped by the statistical frequencies of their training data – dominated by popular culture, brands, platform-speak, and *non-words*. Tokenization is, therefore, a political act: it defines what can be represented and how the world becomes computationally representable. We will look at specific tokens and ask: Which models use which vocabularies? What *non-word* tokens are shared among models? And how do language models make sense of a world using a language we do not understand?

        <abstract>The TitanM2 chip has been central to the security of the google pixel series since the Pixel 6. It is based on a modified RISC-V design with a bignum accelerator. Google added some non standard instructions to the RISC-V ISA. This talk investigates the reverse engineering using Ghidra, and simulation of the firmware in python.</abstract>
        <description>I will discuss the problems encountered while reverse engineering and simulating the firmware for the TitanM2 security chip, found in the Google Pixel phones. I'll discuss how to obtain the firmware. Talk about the problems reverse engineering this particular binary. I show how you can easily extend ghidra with new instructions to get a full decompilation. Also, I wrote a Risc-V simulator in python for running the titanM2 firmware.

        <abstract>This talk demonstrates end-to-end prompt injection exploits that compromise agentic systems. Specifically, we will discuss exploits that target computer-use and coding agents, such as Anthropic's Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Google Jules, Devin AI, ChatGPT Operator, Amazon Q, AWS Kiro, and others. &#13;
&#13;
Exploits will impact confidentiality, system integrity, and the future of AI-driven automation, including remote code execution, exfiltration of sensitive information such as access tokens, and even joining Agents to traditional command and control infrastructure. Which are known as "ZombAIs", a term first coined by the presenter as well as long-term prompt injection persistence in AI coding agents.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, we will explore how nation state TTPs such as ClickFix apply to Computer-Use systems and how they can trick AI systems and lead to full system compromise (AI ClickFix). &#13;
&#13;
Finally, we will cover current mitigation strategies and forward-looking recommendations and strategic thoughts.</abstract>
        <description>During the Month of AI Bugs (August 2025), I responsibly disclosed over two dozen security vulnerabilities across all major agentic AI coding assistants. This talk distills the most severe findings and patterns observed.

Key highlights include:
* Critical prompt-injection exploits enabling zero-click data exfiltration and arbitrary remote code execution across multiple platforms and vendor products
* Recurring systemic flaws such as over-reliance on LLM behavior for trust decisions, inadequate sandboxing of tools, and weak user-in-the-loop controls.
* How I leveraged AI to find some of these vulnerabilities quickly
* The AI Kill Chain: prompt injection, confused deputy behavior, and automatic tool invocation
* Adaptation of nation-state TTPs (e.g., ClickFix) into AI ClickFix techniques that can fully compromise computer-use systems.
* Insights about vendor responses: from quick patches and CVEs to months of silence, or quiet patching
* AgentHopper will highlight how these vulnerabilities combined could have led to an AI Virus

Finally, the session presents practical mitigations and forward-looking strategies to reduce the growing attack surface of probabilistic, autonomous AI systems.

        <abstract>Both within the EU as well as nationally in Germany, there exists a renewed drive to implement data retention, a practice struck down by the ECJ and discontinued in many national legislations. In parallel, cross-border access to stored data has been mandated within the EU as “e-evidence”, and will soon be extended to 90+ countries under the umbrella of the EU cybercrime convention. In principle, all data stored by service providers will be available to law enforcement as part of a criminal investigation. The timing of both initiatives is not coincidental, as access to data naturally relies on the availability of data.&#13;
The talk will address the state of play on data retention in various legislations, and introduce the practice of cross border access to stored data by law enforcement as well as its shortcomings and threats to privacy and confidentiality.</abstract>
        <description>The Specter of Data Retention is back in the political arena, both as a harmonized, EU-wide approach as well as being part of the coalition agreement of the new German national government. Other countries have already recently implemented new data retention laws, i.e. Belgium or Denmark. 
In parallel, access to all types of stored data – and not only data stored under a data retention regime – by law enforcement has been radically reformed by groundbreaking new legislation, undermining both exiting national safeguards as well as protections implemented by businesses aiming for a higher standard in cyber security and data protection.  
The talk will give an overview on recent developments for a harmonized “minimum” approach to data retention under the Polish and Danish EU presidency as well as the new German legislation currently under consideration. 
It will introduce the upcoming international release mechanisms for stored data under the e-evidence legislation, the 2nd protocol to the EU cybercrime convention as well as future threats from the UN cybercrime convention. 
It will address how a cross-border request for information works in practice, which types of data can be requested by whom, and who will be responsible for the few remaining safeguards – including an analysis of the threat model and potential “side channel” attacks by cybercrime to gain access to basically all data stored by and with service providers.

Auch bei Fram2, der ersten bemannten Mission, die beide Polarregionen überflog, war der Sprechfunkkontakt mit einer Universität fest eingeplant.

Der studentische Funkclub "AFuTUB" (https://dk0tu.de) an der TU Berlin hat die Crew der Fram2 angefunkt – mit einem experimentellen Funksetup, das für viele von uns Neuland war.

Wir geben Einblicke in zwei intensive Wochen Planung, Koordination und Aufbau, den Betrieb einer (improvisierten) Bodenstation, sprechen über technische Hürden, Antennendesign und Organisation – und wie wir schließlich mit der Astronautin Rabea Rogge im Weltraum gefunkt haben.

        <abstract>The talk will be about our experience from building an open-architecture secure element from the ground up. It explains why openness became part of the security model, how it reshaped design and development workflows, and where reality pushed back — through legal constraints, third-party IP, or export controls. It walks through the secure boot chain, attestation model, firmware update flow, integration APIs, and the testing framework built for external inspection. Real examples of security evaluations by independent researchers are presented, showing what was learned from their findings and how those exchanges raised the overall security bar. The goal is to provoke discussion on how open collaboration can make hardware more verifiable, adaptable, auditable and while keeping secure.</abstract>
        <description>This talk shares our engineering experience from designing and implementing an open-architecture secure element — a type of chip that is traditionally closed and opaque. We’ll outline the practical consequences of choosing openness as part of the security model: how it affected hardware architecture, firmware design, verification, and development workflows.
The session dives into concrete technical areas including the secure boot chain, attestation and update flow, key storage isolation, and the testing and fuzzing infrastructure used to validate the design. It also covers the boundaries of openness — where third-party IP, export control, or certification requirements force certain blocks to remain closed — and how we document and mitigate those limits.
We’ll present anonymized examples of external security evaluations, show how responsible disclosure and transparent fixes improved resilience, and reflect on what “community-driven security” means in a hardware context. Attendees should leave with a clearer view of what it takes to make security verifiable at the silicon level — and why that process is never finished.

        <abstract>A brief history of typographic misbehavior or intended and unintended uses of variable fonts.&#13;
&#13;
Nine years after the introduction of variable fonts, their most exciting uses have little to do with what variable fonts originally were intended for and their original promise of smaller file sizes. The talk looks at how designers turned a pragmatic font format into a field for experimentation — from animated typography and uniwidth button text to pattern fonts and typographic side effects with unintended aesthetics. Using examples from projects such as TypoLabs, Marjoree, Kario (the variable font that’s used as part of the 39C3 visual identity), and Bronco, we’ll explore how variable fonts evolved from efficiency tools into creative systems — and why the most interesting ideas often emerge when technology is used in unintended ways.</abstract>
        <description>When the OpenType 1.8 specification introduced variable fonts in 2016, the idea was simple: combine all weights and styles of a font family into one file and save file size and therefore bandwidth. Yet in 2025, variable fonts have become a platform for artistic and technical exploration far beyond their initial goal.

This talk follows that transformation from the inside. It starts with a short history of flexible font technologies — Adobe’s Multiple Master and Apple’s TrueType GX formats of the 1990s (I am just mentioning the company names as they were the publishers of these technologies) — and how they failed to become standards. It then shows why variable fonts succeeded: many designers today are more tech savvy and know some basic HTML, CSS and maybe even some JavaScript. And at the same time all major browsers and almost all design apps support variable fonts  by now.

From there, I present a series of first-hand projects where typography met code:
– TypoLabs (2017), whose identity used a custom variable font animating between extremes of weight and width → the variable font family became the (probably forever) unpublished variable font family Denman;
– Marjoree (2024), a pair of variable pattern fonts based on hexagonal and pentagonal tilings that explore legibility and repetition;
– Kario (2025), a duplex variable font powering the 39C3 identity, with uniwidth weights, optical-size adjustments, and typographic Easter eggs;
– and Bronco (2017?), an experiment using the arbitrary-axis model for interpolation to escape the cube-shaped multiple master design space of traditional variable fonts.

The talk then moves from history to speculation. Early head-tracking experiments once tried to adjust a variable font’s optical size based on reader position — producing total chaos as text reshaped itself while being read. On the other hand this playful chaos marks the moment when things become truly interesting: connecting a font axis to live data, to mouse movement, to sound, to network input — anything that makes type responsive and alive. That’s the kind of misbehavior I want to talk about — not breaking for the sake of breaking, but using technology the “wrong” way to see what happens.

The talk will mix images, a lot of short videos, and a bit of behind-the-scenes insight into font development. It’s about what happens when design tools meet code, and how that intersection keeps typography alive and unpredictable.

        <abstract>Jahrelang war die staatliche Intransparenz in Österreich nur eine Punchline in den Congress-Talks von Frag Den Staat. Damit könnte jetzt Schluss sein: seit heuer haben Bürger:innen endlich ein Recht, Dokumente einzusehen und ein Informationsfreiheitsgesetz. Wir zeigen, was Deutschland aus der über ein Jahrzehnt andauernden Kampagne für die Abschaffung des Amtsgeheimnisses lernen kann, wofür uns die Nachbarländer beneiden werden und wofür sich Bayern besonders schämen sollte.</abstract>
        <description>Die Kampagne – wie aus "binnen zwei Wochen" mehr als elf Jahre wurden
Die Strategien – die man übernehmen kann
Der Vergleich – wie ist Österreichische IFG im Vergleich zum Deutschen, und ist das der richtige
Die (besten) Preisträger – aus mehr als zehn Jahren des Schmähpreises "Mauer des Schweigens"
Die Datenhalde – mit Aufruf, was aus dem Datenberg zu machen

        <abstract>This talk explores the internals of Overwatch which make the game work under the hood. &#13;
&#13;
The end goal is to democratise development of Overwatch. Being able to host your own servers and modify the game client to your liking should not be up for discussion for a game many people have paid money for.</abstract>
        <description>Hey you! Yes you! Do you want to pay for a game which gets forcibly taken away from you after only six years? Do you want to buy lootboxes in order to unlock cosmetics faster in the game you „own“?

Overwatch 1 was released in 2016 to critical acclaim and millions of sales globally. It has permanently changed the hero-shooter landscape which was in much need of a fresh new game and playstyle. After a few hard years plagued with infrequent updates, long overdue hero nerfs / reworks and broken promises, Overwatch 1 was finally taken offline on October 3, 2022.

Ever since I started playing Overwatch I was fascinated by the game and it’s proprietary engine, Tank. Not much is known about it, only that core components were reused from the cancelled Blizzard IP, Titan. It’s a shame that this game (engine) is not getting the recognition it deserves. From the entity-component architecture to the deterministic graph based scripting engine which handles (almost) everything which happens ingame, it is a truly refreshing take on networking and game programming rarely seen in games. So, considering this, building a game server from scratch can’t be that hard, riiiight?

Join me in this documentation of my gradual descent into madness while I (jokingly) roast Overwatch developers for code which they probably do not even remember that theyve written 10+ years ago :)

All research presented in this talk was done on the first archived, still publicly available version which I could find, 0.8.0.0 Beta (0.8.24919), which got uploaded to archive.org.

        <abstract>Der Vortrag beschreibt, wie eine Gruppe von Begeisterten eine Sammlung von ca. 100 Flipperautomaten (Pinball Machines) am Leben und in spielbereitem Zustand erhält.</abstract>
        <description>Der Vortrag gibt einen Einblick in die verschiedenen Generationen von Flippern und deren Technik. Angefangen von elektromechanischen Geräten aus den frühen Sechzigern, über erste Prozessorsteuerungen, bis hin zu modernsten computergesteuerten Automaten mit Bussystemen. Jede Generation hat ihre technischen Eigenheiten, ihre typischen Fehlermuster und Schwachstellen. 
In öffentlichen Räumen sind heutzutage kaum mehr Flipper anzutreffen. Das liegt insbesondere daran, dass deren Wartung aufwändig ist, weil durch die mechanische Beanspruchung häufig Fehler auftreten. Bereits kleinste technische Probleme können den Spielspaß zunichte machen.
Das Finden und Beheben von Fehlern erfordert viel Erfahrung – und manchmal Kreativität, insbesondere wenn alte Bauteile nicht mehr verfügbar sind oder kaum Dokumentation vorhanden ist. Technisch ist Sachverstand auf vielen Ebenen erforderlich, vom Schaltplanlesen über Löten und elektronische Messtechnik, bis hin zu mechanischem Know-how.
Die Community der Flipper-Enthusiasten ist allerdings groß und kooperativ, sodass auch private Sammler ihre Flipper am Laufen halten können.

        <abstract>"Don't roll your own crypto" is an often-repeated aphorism. It's good advice -- but then how does any cryptography get made? Writers of cryptography code like myself write code with bugs just like anyone else, so how do we take precautions against our own mistakes? In this talk, I will give a peek into the cryptographer's toolbox of advanced techniques to avoid bugs: targeted testing, model checking, mathematical proof assistants, information-flow analysis, and more. None of these techniques is a magic silver bullet, but they can help find flaws in reasoning about tricky corner cases in low-level code or prove that higher-level designs are sound, given a defined set of assumptions. We'll go over some examples and try to give a high-level feel for different workflows that create "high-assurance" code. Whether you know it or not, you use this type of cryptography code every day: in your browser, your messaging apps, and your favorite programming language standard libraries.</abstract>
        <description>Over the last 10 years or so, using mathematical proof assistants and other formal-logic tools for cryptography code has gone from a relatively new idea to standard practice. I've been lucky enough to have a front-row seat to that transformation, having started doing formal-methods research in 2015 and then switched to a focus on cryptography implementation since 2021. Code from my master's thesis project, ["fiat-crypto"](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto), is [included](https://andres.systems/fiat-crypto-adoption.html) in every major browser as well as AWS, Cloudflare, Linux, OpenBSD, and standard crypto libraries for Go, Zig, and Rust (RustCrypto, dalek). In addition to verifying code correctness, designers of high-level protocols like Signal's recently announced post-quantum ratchet increasingly use mathematical tools (ProVerif in Signal's case) to check their work.

Despite the growing popularity of these formal techniques and their relevance to personal information security, few people are aware of them, and they maintain a reputation for being hard to learn and esoteric. I'd like to demystify the topic and show examples of how anyone can use proof assistants in small, standalone ways as part of the coding or design process. My hope is that next time a colleague asks for review of a complex high-speed bit-twiddling algorithm, instead of staring at the code line-by-line, attendees of my talk will know they can write a computer-checked proof to confirm or deny that the algorithm achieves its intended result.

        <abstract>What happens when AI-powered criminals meet AI-powered hunters? A technical arms race where both sides are vibing their way through exploitation—and the backdoors write themselves.&#13;
&#13;
In October 2025, we investigated Taiwan's fake delivery scam ecosystem targeting convenience store customers. What started as social engineering on social media became a deep dive into two distinct fraud platforms—both bearing the unmistakable fingerprints of AI-generated code. Their developers left more than just bugs: authentication flaws, file management oversights, and database implementations that screamed "I asked LLM and deployed without reading." We turned their sloppiness into weaponized OSINT. Through strategic reconnaissance, careful database analysis, and meticulous operational security, we achieved complete system access on multiple fraud infrastructures. By analyzing server artifacts and certificate patterns, we mapped 100+ active domains and extracted evidence linking thousands of victim transactions worth millions of euros in fraud. But here's the twist: we used the same AI tools they did, just with better prompts.&#13;
&#13;
The takeaway isn't just about hunting scammers—it's about the collapse of the skill gap in both offense and defense. When vibe coding meets vibe hacking, the underground economy democratizes in ways we never anticipated. We'll share our methodology for fingerprinting AI-assisted crime infrastructure, discuss the ethical boundaries of counter-operations, and demonstrate how to build sustainable threat intelligence pipelines when your adversary can redeploy in 5 minutes. This talk proves that in 2025, the real exploit isn't zero-day—it's zero-understanding.</abstract>
        <description>Our journey began with a simple question: why are so many people losing money to fake convenience store delivery websites? The answer led us through two distinct criminal architectures, both exhibiting characteristics of large language model–assisted development.

Case 1 ran on PHP with backup artifacts exposing implementation details and query manipulation opportunities. The installation package itself contained pre-existing access mechanisms—whether this was developer insurance or criminal-on-criminal sabotage remains unclear. We leveraged initial access to bypass security restrictions using protocol-level manipulation and extracted gigabytes of operational data.

Case 2 featured authentication bypass vulnerabilities that granted direct administrative access. The backend structure revealed copy-pasted code patterns without proper security implementation.

Throughout both systems, we observed telltale signs of AI-generated code: verbose documentation in unexpected languages, inconsistent coding patterns, textbook-like naming conventions, and theoretical security implementations. Even the UI revealed LLM fingerprints—overly polished component layouts, placeholder text patterns, and design choices that felt distinctly "tutorial-like." These weren't experienced developers—they were operators deploying what LLMs gave them without understanding the internals.

The irony? We used AI extensively too: for data parsing, pattern recognition, attack surface mapping, and intelligence queries. The difference was intentionality—we understood what the output meant.

Using open-source intelligence platforms and carefully crafted fingerprints, we mapped over a hundred active domains following similar patterns. Each one shared the same architecture, the same weaknesses, the same developer mistakes. This repeatability became our advantage. When scammers can redeploy infrastructure in days, you don't attack individual sites—you automate the entire reconnaissance-to-evidence pipeline.

This talk demonstrates practical techniques for mass-scale fraud infrastructure fingerprinting, operational security considerations when investigating active criminal operations, and methods to recognize AI-generated code patterns that reveal threat actor sophistication. We'll discuss the ethical boundaries of counter-fraud operations and evidence preservation for law enforcement, along with automation strategies for sustainable threat intelligence when adversaries rebuild faster than you can report. The demonstration will show how to go from a single suspicious domain to a network map of 100+ sites and thousands of victim records—using tools available to any researcher.

This isn't a story about elite hackers versus criminal masterminds. It's about two groups equally reliant on AI vibing their way through technical problems—one for fraud, one for justice. The skill barrier has collapsed. The question now is: who has better context, better ethics, and better coffee?

        <abstract>The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and its SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) protocol are public alerting technologies that broadcast short digital bursts over VHF triggering emergency messages on millions of receivers across North America. In Mexico, this technology was integrated into the Seismic Alert System (SASMEX) which more than 30 million people in the central part of the country rely on to prepare for frequent earthquakes.&#13;
&#13;
While new alerting technologies have emerged, the EAS-SAME network continues to play an important role for public safety in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Yet, the same small packets of bits that can help protect a city could also, in the wrong hands, destabilize it. This talk examines how these systems operate and reveals a troubling truth: spoofing these alerts is far easier than most people expect.</abstract>
        <description>In this talk, we’ll begin by contextualizing the importance of the seismic alert in Mexico City, a system born from the devastating 1985 earthquake. We’ll examine how it was designed, how it works, and why it carries such a deep psychological impact.

From there, we’ll explore the history and design of Weather Radio and the SAME protocol, looking at how messages are transmitted and encoded through this technology, and how it was later adapted for SASMEX.

I’ll also share my personal experience building compatible receivers, from early open-source experiments that inspired local manufacturers to create government-certified devices, to developing a receiver as part of my undergraduate thesis.

We’ll analyze how simplicity, one of the key strengths of these systems, also introduces certain risks, and how these trade-offs emerge when dealing with accessibility, interoperability, and security in system design.

Finally, I’ll demonstrate how to receive, decode, and encode these alert messages, and discuss how, with the right equipment, it’s possible to generate such alert signals.

        <abstract>Könntest du jetzt noch sagen, was du heute online gemacht hast? Für viele ist das Internet so selbstverständlich, dass sie es kaum noch merken, wenn sie es benutzen. Dennoch sind viele Menschen unfreiwillig aus der digitalen Welt ausgeschlossen. Wie könnte das Internet für alle nutzbar werden?</abstract>
        <description>Für viele Menschen ist es selbstverständlich, online unterwegs zu sein. Dennoch sind weiterhin viele Menschen mit Beeinträchtigung online ausgeschlossen. Seit Juni 2025 sind durch das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz ist digitale Barrierefreiheit für Unternehmen verpflichtend. Damit ist digitale Barrierefreiheit von einer Option zu einem Recht geworden. Trotz der gesetzlichen Vorgaben scheitert die digitale Barrierefreiheit in der Praxis häufig an der fehlenden Expertise von Verantwortlichen. Wir möchten aus drei Perspektiven auf Barrierefreiheit in der digitalen Welt schauen:

Lena Müller ist Entwicklerin und für die barrierefreie Gestaltung von Inhalten verantwortlich. Kathrin Klapper promoviert und nutzt in ihrem Alltag zum Sprechen einen Sprachcomputer mit Augensteuerung. Und Jakob Sponholz setzt sich in seiner Forschung mit der Frage auseinander, wie digitale Medien zur Inklusion beitragen können.

Wir möchten zunächst einen Einblick in die Mechanismen geben, die digitale Inklusion verhindern - sowohl theoretisch als auch praktisch. Anschließend möchten wir anhand von einfachen Beispielen zeigen, dass der Einstieg in die Gestaltung von barrierefreien Inhalten eigentlich gar nicht so schwer ist und es sich lohnt, einfach anzufangen.

        <abstract>Auf der Insel Rügen und in Österreich tut sich was - und zwar neue Chaos Events. Wir möchten über Anforderungen, Herausforderungen, Hürden, Erfahrungen und Glücksmomente aus unserer Sicht der Orga erzählen. Das InselChaos fand im LaGrange e.V. im September 2025 statt und bildet den Auftakt für weitere kreative, informative und chaotische Events auf der Insel Rügen. Das Håck ma’s Castle wird mit etwas Humor auch über Herausforderungen sprechen, welche unter anderem durch dezentrale Teams aus diversen Hackspaces entstehen.</abstract>
        <description>**InselChaos**
Der Port39 e.V. hatte den Traum, das Chaos nach MV zu holen und ein größeres Event an der Ostsee zu veranstalten. Gerade erst 3 Jahre alt, haben wir mit der Planung in kleinem Kreis begonnen. Eine Location musste gesucht, Inspirationen und Ideen gesammelt, bürokratische Hürden und sehr viele individuelle Probleme gelöst werden, bis es Anfang September soweit war, dass wir unsere Gäste begrüßen durften. In diesem Talk sprechen wir darüber, wie es ist, als kleiner Verein mit einem vierköpfigen Orga-Team ein ChaosEvent mit über 150 Gästen zu koordinieren, welche Schwierigkeiten wir dabei überwunden und vor allem, welche Learnings wir daraus gezogen haben, um es nächstes Mal noch besser zu machen.


**Håck ma’s Castle**
Wir werden in unserem Talk, darüber sprechen, welche Methoden und Meetingmodi wir ausgetestet haben, gute wie aber auch schlechte Entscheidungen welche getroffen wurden. Vorallem aber auch über die Herausforderung, die es mit sich bringt, wenn sich Wesen noch nicht kennen und wir zuerst auf menschlicher Ebene auch zusammenkommen mussten, damit es inhaltlich auch besser klappt.

Hard facts Håck ma's Castle:
- 3 (+1) Tage Event
- August 2024
- mit Schloss
- mit Camping
- ~330 Wesen
- inklusive 1 Schlosskatze *meow*
- Orga verteilt in ganz Österreich und darüber hinaus:
- metalab, realraum, C3W, CCC Salzburg, /dev/lol, SegFaultDragons, SegVault, IT-Syndikat, /usr/space, Gebärdenverse, female coders, chaos.jetzt etc.

        <description>Am 26. September wurde gegen Hanna vor dem OLG München das erste Urteil gegen eine der Antifaschist*innen im Rahmen des Budapest-Komplexes gefällt: 5 Jahre für ein lediglich auf Indizien basierendes Urteil. Dem Mordvorwurf der Staatsanwaltschaft wurde nicht entsprochen, behauptet wurde aber die Existenz einer gewalttätigen „kriminellen Vereinigung“.
Am 12. Januar 2026 wird nun vor dem OLG Düsseldorf der Prozess gegen Nele, Emmi, Paula, Luca, Moritz und Clara, die seit Januar in verschiedenen Gefängnissen in U-Haft sitzen, eröffnet. Die Anklage konstruiert auch hier eine kriminelle Vereinigung nach §129 und enthält den Vorwurf des versuchten Mordes. Die Verfahren in dieser Weise zu verfolgen, lässt vor allem auf ein hohes Ausforschungs- und Einschüchterungsinteresse schließen.
Zaid, gegen den ein europäischer Haftbefehl aus Ungarn vorliegt, war Anfang Mai unter Meldeauflagen entlassen worden; aufgrund seiner nicht-deutschen Staatsangehörigkeit hatte der Generalbundesanwalt keine Anklage gegen ihn erhoben. Da er in Deutschland nach wie vor von einer Überstellung nach Ungarn bedroht ist, hält er sich seit Oktober 2025 in Paris auf. Er ist gegen Auflagen auf freiem Fuß.
Ein weiteres Verfahren im Budapest- Komplex wird in Dresden zusammen mit Vorwürfen aus dem Antifa Ost Verfahren verhandelt. Der Prozess gegen Tobi, Johann, Thomas (Nanuk), Paul und zwei weitere Personen wird bereits im November beginnen.
In Budapest sitzt Maja – entgegen einer einstweiligen Verfügung des BVerfG und festgestellt rechtswidrig im Juni 2024 nach Ungarn überstellt - weiterhin in Isolationshaft; der Prozess soll erst im Januar fortgeführt werden und voraussichtlich mit dem Urteil am 22.01. zu Ende gehen.
Mit den Prozessen im Budapest-Komplex wird ein Exempel statuiert – nicht nur gegen Einzelne, sondern gegen antifaschistische Praxis insgesamt. Die Behauptung einer kriminellen Vereinigung mit Mordabsichten stellt eine absurde juristische Eskalation des staatlichen Vorgehens gegen Antifaschist*innen dar und steht in keinem Verhältnis zu den verhandelten Vorkommnissen.
Mit dieser Prozesswelle und den Repressionen gegen Freund*innen und Angehörige wird antifaschistisches Engagement massiv kriminalisiert und ein verzerrtes Bild von politischem Widerstand gezeichnet – während gleichzeitig rechte Gewalt europaweit zunimmt und faschistische Parteien erstarken. Wir sehen, dass Angriffe auf Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Zivilgesellschaf immer weiter zunehmen. Die Art und Weise, wie gegen die Antifas im Budapest-Komplex vorgegangen wird, ist ein Vorgeschmack darauf, wie politische Opposition in einer autoritäreren Zukunft behandelt werden könnte. Wir sind alle von der rechtsautoritären Entwicklung, von Faschisierung betroffen. Die Kriminalisierung von Antifas als „terroristische Vereinigung" ist Teil einer (weltweiten) Entdemokratisierung und Zersetzung von Rechtsstaatlichkeit.

        <abstract>Der Trend geht dahin, aus Gesundheitsdaten große zentralisierte Datenbanken aufzubauen. Eine datensparsame Alternative dazu ist, in einem verschlüsseltem Netzwerk gemeinsam auf verteilten privaten Daten zu rechnen, ohne sie miteinander teilen zu müssen. Perspektivisch können so demokratischere Datenströme geschaffen werden, die Patient:innen als aktiv Teilhabende statt als passive Datenquellen einbinden. Kommt mit auf eine Reise, die vor sechs Jahren in Deutschland gestartet ist und jetzt die erste europäische klinische Studie mit Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) realisiert hat.</abstract>
        <description>**Klinische Forschung 101:** Warum sind "multizentrische" klinische Studien der Goldstandard und wie läuft das ab? Welche Daten werden da gesammelt und wie funktioniert in der Praxis der Datenaustausch? Was sagt die DSGVO dazu?

**Sicheres verteiltes Rechnen 101:** Wie kann man in verschlüsselten peer-to-peer Netzwerken gemeinsam auf verteilten Daten rechnen, ohne die Eingabedaten untereinander austauschen zu müssen? Was sind technische Vor- und Nachteile? Was ändert das an den Rollen der Akteure im System?

**Der Prototyp in Deutschland 2019:** Das LMU Klinikum in München kooperiert mit der Charité in Berlin und der TU München. Zum ersten Mal gelingt das gemeinsame Rechnen auf verteilten Patient:innendaten. Diverse lessons were learned.

**Die erste europäische Studie 2024:** Das LMU Klinikum in München kooperiert mit der Policlinico Universitario Fondazione Agostino Gemelli in Rom. Aus der Pilotstudie ergibt sich auch ein DSGVO-konformer Blueprint und eine wiederverwendbare Architektur.

**Fazit und Ausblick:** Sicheres verteiltes Rechnen in der Wissenschaft und darüber hinaus.

        <abstract>Der Vortrag diskutiert Herausforderungen dezentraler Netzwerke aus soziologischer Perspektive. Als dezentrale Netzwerke werden technische Infrastrukturen verstanden, die nicht von einer zentralen Autorität, sondern verteilt über Instanzen zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Nutzer:innen profitieren von dieser Infrastruktur, nutzen beispielsweise das Fediverse oder das Tor-Netzwerk, ohne zur Infrastruktur beizutragen. Zugleich können dezentrale Netzwerke nur dann bestehen, wenn hinreichende Ressourcen von Personen oder Organisationen mobilisiert werden, um das Netzwerk überhaupt zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dies führt zur originären Instabilität dezentraler Netzwerke, wenn nicht der Weg der Kommodifizierung des Nutzer:innenverhaltens eingeschlagen wird. Aufbauend auf dieser Zustandsbeschreibung, werden Bedingungen erörtert, um Kollektivgüter wie dezentrale Netzwerke organisatorisch (und nicht technisch) herzustellen. Hierzu zählen Partizipation oder die Idee einer öffentlichen Grundfinanzierung. Der Vortrag wird neben soziologischen Ideen und harten Zahlen auch durch eine ordentliche Portion Idealismus zu Fragen der Souveränität und Autonomität in der Digitalisierung motiviert.</abstract>
        <description>Die Soziologie hat immer etwas mitzuteilen, sobald Fragen kollektiven Handelns auftreten. Dies gilt sowohl für soziale wie auch digitale Räume. So hat der Soziologe Peter Kollock bereits in den 1990er Jahren festgestellt, „the Internet is filled with junk and jerks“ (Kollock, 1999, S. 220). Gegenwärtig dürfte die Mehrheit dieser Aussage anstandslos zustimmen. Aber dies ist nicht der entscheidende Punkt, sondern die weitere Beobachtung: „Given that online interaction is relatively anonymous, that there is no central authority, and that it is difficult or impossible to impose monetary or physical sanctions on someone, it is striking that the Internet is not literally a war of all against all” (1999, S. 220).

Die Welt kennt inzwischen zahlreiche Gegenbeispiele, bei denen Autoritäten das Internet nutzen, um das Nutzungsverhalten zu monetarisieren oder Überwachungstechnologien zur Sanktionierung einsetzen (Zuboff, 2019). Diese Ausgangslage beziehe ich in meiner Forschung ein, wenn ich dezentrale Netzwerke wie das Fediverse oder das Tor-Netzwerk aus soziologischer Perspektive betrachte. In erster Linie bin ich daran interessiert zu verstehen, wie dezentrale Netzwerke – organisatorisch nicht technisch – entstehen und welche Herausforderungen es dabei zu überwinden gilt (Sanders &amp; Van Dijck, 2025). Eine zentrale Motivation orientiert sich an der Frage, wie ein Internet ohne zentrale Autorität, verringert von Marktabhängigkeiten, resilient gegenüber Sanktionsmechanismen und Souverän bezüglich eigener Daten, aufgebaut werden kann. Motiviert durch diesen präskriptiven Rahmen, betrachte ich im Vortrag die Herausforderungen zunächst deskriptiv und beziehe meine soziologische Perspektive ein. Denn in der Regel profitieren Menschen, die einen Vorteil aus der Realisierung eines bestimmten Ziels ziehen, unabhängig davon, ob sie persönlich einen Anteil der Kooperation tragen – oder eben nicht. Das kollektive Handeln fällt mitunter schwer, obwohl oder gerade, weil ein begründetes kollektives Interesse zur Umsetzung eines bestimmten Zieles besteht. Gleiche Interessen sind nicht gleichbedeutend mit gemeinsamen Interessen. Diese Situationsbeschreibung ist vielfältig anwendbar von WG-Aufräumplänen bis zu Fragen der klimaneutralen Transformation. Der Grund ist, dass kollektives Handeln ein Mindestmaß an Zeit, Aufwand oder Geld verursacht, sodass vielfach ein Trittbrettfahren gewählt wird in der Hoffnung, dass immer noch genug andere kooperieren, um das gewünschte Ziel zu erreichen (Hardin, 1982).

Aus dieser Perspektive betrachte ich dezentrale Netzwerke. So kann das Fediverse oder der Tor-Browser genutzt werden, ohne eine eigene Instanz oder Knoten zu hosten. Dies ist auch nicht das Ziel der genannten dezentralen Netzwerke. Dennoch: Die Kosten und der Aufwand für die technische Infrastruktur müssen von einem kleinen Teil getragen werden, während die überwältigende Mehrheit der Nutzer:innen von der Infrastruktur profitieren, ohne einen Beitrag zu dieser zu leisten. Dies führt zur originären Instabilität dezentraler Netzwerke und stellt eine relevante Herausforderung für die Zukunft dar. Während durch Netzwerkanalysen das Wachstum und die Verstetigung von dezentralen Netzwerken beschrieben wird, fehlt es an einem vertieften Verständnis über Bedingungen wie dezentrale Netzwerke überhaupt entstehen. Während des Vortrags werde ich empirische Daten zur Entwicklung des Fediverse und des Tor-Netzwerkes zeigen, um die Herausforderung zu verdeutlichen. Insbesondere das Tor-Netzwerk steht dabei vor dem Problem, dass die Möglichkeit zur De-Anonymisierung steigt, wenn die Anzahl an Knoten sinkt. Die Überwindung des von mir dargestellten Kollektivgutproblems nimmt demnach eine zentrale Rolle zur Aufrechterhaltung ein.

Die Motivation sich mit dezentralen Netzwerken auseinanderzusetzen, resultiert aus der Umkehr der Argumentation, wenn Netzwerke über eine zentrale Autorität verfügen und zugleich in der Lage sind, Sanktionsmechanismen zu nutzen, beispielsweise um unliebsame User:innen zu sperren, das Nutzungsverhalten zu überwachen und zu monetarisieren (Zuboff, 2019). Hierbei beziehe ich mich offensichtlich auf die Entwicklung sozialer Medien, die das oben beschriebene Problem kollektiven Handelns durch Kommodifizierung der Infrastruktur lösen. Ähnliches ist aus dem Bereich der Kryptowährung bekannt, welche ebenfalls durch den individualisierten monetären Vorteil, das heißt der Verheißung einer Kapitalakkumulation, Kooperationsprobleme überwindet. Stellen wir uns so die Zukunft des Internets vor?
Dezentrale Netzwerke sind nicht per se eine allumfassende technische Lösung für gesellschaftlich-soziale Probleme. Im Gegenteil: Dezentrale Netzwerke, wenn sie nicht auf Kommodifizierung basieren, unterliegen einer sozialen Ordnung, die sich eben nicht technisch lösen lässt. Ein Bewusstsein über die Notwendigkeit dezentraler Netzwerke ist hierbei leider nicht ausreichend, sondern es braucht Menschen und Organisationen, die bereit sind einen Teil der Infrastruktur zu tragen, ohne einen direkten Vorteil hiervon zu erhalten. Diese Selbstorganisation steht im Vergleich zu profitorientierten Unternehmen immer im Nachteil (Offe &amp; Wiesenthal, 1980).

In meiner Forschung verbinde ich mein Interesse an Grundstrukturen und Bedingungen sozialer Ordnung, wie dem Kooperationsproblem, mit dem Anspruch gesellschaftlicher Gestaltung. Allein das Bewusstsein über diese Bedingungen kann noch kein Kooperationsproblem lösen. Es kann allerdings helfen, den Rahmen dieser Bedingungen aktiv zu gestalten. Ich werde mich dabei zwischen kritischen Realitäten und hoffnungsvollen Ausblicken bewegen, denn ganz offensichtlich existieren dezentrale Netzwerke, die eine organisatorische und technische Alternative anbieten. Doch wie der Titel suggeriert, hilft hier auf die Dauer nur die (zivilgesellschaftliche) Power.

        <abstract>HostileShop is a python-based tool for generating prompt injections and jailbreaks against LLM agents. I created HostileShop to see if I could use LLMs to write a framework that generates prompt injections against LLMs, by having LLMs attack other LLMs. It's LLMs all the way down. HostileShop generated prompt injections for a winning submission in OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B RedTeam Contest. Since then, I have expanded HostileShop to generate injections for the entire LLM frontier, as well as to mutate jailbreaks to bypass prompt filters, adapt to LLM updates, and to give advice on performing injections against other agent systems. In this talk, I will give you an overview of LLM Agent hacking. I will cover LLM context window formats, LLM agents, agent vulnerability surface, and the prompting and efficiency insights that led to the success of HostileShop.</abstract>
        <description>[HostileShop](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/HostileShop) creates a simulated web shopping environment where an **attacker agent LLM** attempts to manipulate a **target shopping agent LLM** into performing unauthorized actions. Crucially, HostileShop does not use an LLM to judge attack success. Instead, success is determined automatically and immediately by the framework, which reduces costs and enables rapid continual learning by the attacker LLM.

HostileShop is best at discovering **prompt injections** that induce LLM Agents to make improper "tool calls". In other words, HostileShop finds the magic spells that make LLM Agents call functions that they have available to them, often with the specific input of your choice.

HostileShop is also capable of [enhancement and mutation of "universal" jailbreaks](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/HostileShop?tab=readme-ov-file#prompts-for-jailbreakers). This allows **cross-LLM adaptation of universal jailbreaks** that are powerful enough to make the target LLM become fully under your control, for arbitrary actions. This also enables public jailbreaks that have been partially blocked to work again, until they are more comprehensively addressed.

I created HostileShop as an experiment, but continue to maintain it to let me know if/when LLM agents finally become secure enough for use in privacy preserving systems, without the need to rely on [oppressive](https://runtheprompts.com/resources/chatgpt-info/chatgpt-is-reporting-your-prompts-to-police/) [levels of surveillance](https://www.anthropic.com/news/activating-asl3-protections).

        <abstract>While FPGA developers usually try to minimize the power consumption of their designs, we approached the problem from the opposite perspective: what is the maximum power consumption that can be achieved or wasted on an FPGA? Short answer: we found that it’s easy to implement oscillators running at 6 GHz that can theoretically dissipate around 20 kW on a large cloud FPGA when driving the signal to all the available resources. It is interesting to note that this power density is not very far away from that of the surface of the sun. However, such power load jump is usually not a problem as it will trigger some protection circuitry. This led us to the next question: would a localized hotspot with such power density damage the chip if we remain within the typical power envelope of a cloud FPGA (~100 W)? While we could not “fry” the chip or induce permanent errors (and we tried several variants), we did observe that a few routing wires aged to become up to 70% slower in just a few days of stressing the chip. This basically means that such an FPGA cannot be rented out to cloud users without risking timing violations.&#13;
In this talk, we will present how we optimized power wasting, how we measured wire latencies with ps accuracy, how we attacked 100 FPGA cloud instances and how we can protect FPGAs against such DOS attacks.</abstract>
        <description>FPGA instances are now offered by multiple cloud service providers (including Amazon EC2 F1/F2 instances, Alibaba ECS Instances, and Microsoft Azure NP-Series). The low-level programmability of FPGAs allows implementing new attack vectors including DOS attacks. While some severe attacks (such as short circuits) cannot be easily deployed as users are prevented to load own configuration bitstreams on the cloud FPGAs, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to leak information (like cloud instance scheduling policies or the physical topologies of the FPGA servers) or to mount DoS attacks by excessive power hammering. For instance, basically all cloud FPGAs provide logic cells that can be configured as small shift registers. This allows building toggle-shift-registers with 10K and more flip-flops, which can draw over 1 KW power when clocked at a few hundred MHz. 
In our work, we created fast ring-oscillators that bypass all design checks applied during bitstream cloud deployment and how we achieved toggle rates of 8 GHz inside an FPGA by using glitch amplification. The latter one was calibrated with the help of a time-to-digital converter (TDC).
As a first attack, we used power hammering to crash AWS F1 instances by increasing power consumption to 300 W (three times the allowed power envelope). We used physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to examine the behaviour of the attacked FPGA cloud instances and we found that most remained unavailable for several hours after the attack.
As a more subtle attack, we tried to cause permanent damage to FPGAs in our lab by driving fast toggling signals to virtually any available wire (and primitive) into a small region of the chip. With this, we created hotspot designs that draw 130 W in less than 1% of the available logic and routing resources of a datacenter FPGA. Even though the achieved power density was excessive, it was insufficient to induce permanent damages. This is largely due to the area inefficiencies of an FPGA that limit the power density. For instance, FPGAs use large multiplexers to implement the switchable connections and there exists only one active path that is routed through the multiplexers, hence, leaving most of the transistors sitting idle. Similarly, FPGAs provide a large number of configuration memory cells (about 1 Gb on a typical datacenter device) that draw negligible power as these do not switch during operation. All these idle elements force the power drawing circuits to be spread out, hence limiting power density. Anyway, when experimenting with different hotspot variants, we found thermal runaway effects and excessive device aging with up to a 70% increase in delay on some wires. We achieved this aging in just a few days and under normal operational conditions (i.e. by staying within the available power budget and having board cooling running). Such a large increase in latency can be considered to render an FPGA useless as it will usually not be fast enough to host (realistic) user designs.
Beyond exploring these attack vectors, we developed countermeasures and design guidelines to prevent such attacks. These include scans of the user designs, use restrictions to resources like IOs and clock trees, as well as runtime monitoring and FPGA health checks. With this, we believe that FPGAs can be operated securely and reliably in a cloud setting.

        <abstract>The USA is demanding from all 43 countries in the "Visa Waiver Programme" (VWP), which enables visa-free travel, to conclude an "Enhanced Border Security Partnership" (EBSP). This is intended to grant US authorities direct access to police databases in these - mostly European - countries containing fingerprints, facial images and other personal data. Anyone who refuses this forced "border partnership" faces exclusion from the visa-free travel programme.</abstract>
        <description>The US demand is unprecedented: even EU member states do not grant each other such extensive direct database access – normally the exchange takes place via the "hit/no-hit principle" with a subsequent request for further data. This is how it works, for example, in the Prüm Treaty among all Schengen states, which has so far covered fingerprints and DNA data and is now also being extended to facial images.

The EBSP could practically affect anyone who falls under the jurisdiction of border authorities: from passport controls to deportation proceedings. Under the US autocrat Donald Trump, this is a particular problem, as his militia-like immigration authority ICE is already using data from various sources to brutally persecute migrants – direct access to police data from VWP partners could massively strengthen this surveillance apparatus. Germany alone might give access to facial images of 5.5 million people and fingerprints of a similar dimension.

The USA has already tightened the Visa Waiver Programme several times, for instance in 2006 through the introduction of biometric passports and in 2008 through the ESTA pre-registration requirement. In addition, there were bilateral agreements for the exchange of fingerprints and DNA profiles – however, these may only be transmitted in individual cases involving serious crime.

Existing treaties such as the EU-US Police Framework Agreement are not applicable to the "Enhanced Border Security Partnership", as it applies exclusively to law enforcement purposes. It is also questionable how the planned data transfer is supposed to be compatible with the strict data protection rules of the GDPR. The EU Commission therefore wants to negotiate a framework agreement on the EBSP that would apply to all member states. Time is running short: the US government has set VWP states a deadline of 31 December 2026. Some already agreed on a bilateral level.

        <abstract>Zwischen offenen Briefen, Massenmails, Petitionen und Kaffee trinken : Zwei Ex-Insiderinnen aus dem  Digitalausschuss und Bundestag erzählen, wie politische Einflussnahme wirklich funktioniert. Ein ehrlicher Blick hinter die Kulissen parlamentarischer Entscheidungsfindung – mit praktischen Tipps, wie die Zivilgesellschaft ihre Energie dort einsetzt, wo sie wirklich Wirkung entfaltet.</abstract>
        <description>Ziel des Talks ist es, ein realistisches Bild davon zu vermitteln, wie parlamentarische Entscheidungsfindung funktioniert – und praktische Hinweise zu geben, wie man Einfluss nehmen kann, ohne dabei Ressourcen zu verschwenden.

Wie bringt man politische Prozesse in Bewegung? Was passiert eigentlich mit einer Mail, wenn sie an einen Abgeordneten geht? Und wie unterscheidet sich konstruktive Interessenvertretung von übergriffigem Lobbyismus?

In diesem Talk berichten Anna Kassautzki (Mitglied des Bundestags von 2021 bis 2025, stellvertretende Vorsitzende des Digitalausschusses 20. LP) und Rahel Becker (ehemalige wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin Digitales) aus der Innenperspektive parlamentarischer Arbeit.

Chatkontrolle, Data Act, Recht auf Open Data, DSGVO, es gab viel zu verhandeln in der letzten Legislaturperiode. Anna und Rahel waren mittendrin und geben einen Einblick in die hektische -  teils absurde Kommunikation mit Interessenvertretungen. Dabei liegt der Fokus immer auf der Frage: Welche Strategien braucht es, damit zivilgesellschaftliche Arbeit nicht verpufft?

Zugleich geht es um die strukturellen Fragen:
Wo sind die Flaschenhälse für politischen Fortschritt? Wie priorisieren Abgeordnete in einem überfüllten Kalender? Und welche Hebel kann die (digitale) Zivilgesellschaft sinnvoll nutzen, um Gehör zu finden?

Denn gerade in Zeiten massiver digitalpolitischer Herausforderungen ist informierte, strategische Beteiligung notwendiger denn je. Ein Vortrag für alle, die sich in politische Prozesse einmischen wollen.

        <abstract>Milliarden von Kameras produzieren täglich Bilder, die zunehmend von Maschinen analysiert werden. In dieser Lecture Performance beleuchten wir die Entwicklung des maschinellen Sehens – von den frühen algorithmischen Ansätzen bis zu den heutigen Anwendungen – und schauen, wie verschiedene Künstler:innen diese Technologien nutzen und reflektieren. Anhand der beiden Arbeiten „Throwback Environment” und „Fomes Fomentarius Digitalis” betrachten wir die Nutzung des maschinellen Sehens in einem künstlerischen Feedback-Loop. Die Arbeiten machen sichtbar, was die eingesetzten Algorithmen sehen und in welchen Mustern sie operieren.</abstract>
        <description>Unmengen an Bilder werden Täglich in die Netzwerke hochgeladen. Doch nicht nur Menschen betrachten diese Bilder, auch Maschinen analysieren und „betrachten" sie. Wie funktioniert dieses maschinelle „Sehen" und wie wurde dieses den Computern beigebracht?
Diese Lecture Performance gibt einen Überblick über die Entwicklung des maschinellen Sehens. Nach einem kurzen Einblick in die geschichtliche Entwicklung – von den ersten Ansätzen bis zu heutigen Anwendungen – betrachten wir, wie diese Technologien in unterschiedlichsten künstlerischen Arbeiten eingesetzt werden. Was reflektieren diese Arbeiten jenseits der reinen Anwendung von Machine Vision Algorithmen?
Anhand der beiden Arbeiten "Throwback Environment" und "Fomes Fomentarius Digitalis" betrachten wir, wie Machine Vision in einem künstlerischen Feedbackloop genutzt worden ist und wie uns dies Perspektiven auf die Funktionsweise dieser Algorithmen eröffnet. Die Arbeiten machen sichtbar, was die Eingesetzten Alghorithmen sehen, in welchen Mustern sie operieren. Sie zeigen auch, wo ihre Grenzen liegen und was das ganze mit Baumpilzen zu tun hat.

        <abstract>Come on stage and present things you are very bad in. Or just mediocre. Get raging applause and love from the audience!&#13;
Hosted by the drag-quings Norman Müller-Schmitz and James Bonne d'age this open stage celebrates trying, failing and the beauty of discovering hidden Talents together when the most beautiful cuties from the audience enter the stage to try something they have absolutely no experience in.</abstract>
        <description>The show is an open format that gives people the space to show themselves, be visible and make themselves vulnerable. We bring a queer format that celebrates people for simply being humans to Hamburgs neighborhood pubs, autonomous stages and other easily accessible spaces. In doing so it's explicitly anti-capitalist, builds communities and unlikely alliances.
Not just in the hacker/CCC community we applaud the cool things people can do: The big stage is often reserved for outstanding achievements; attention and social credits usually go to those who already have the network and skills. While we consider celebrating success to be absolutely necessary, we see the need to give people space to try things out, to fail publicly without having to be ashamed, and to celebrate Imperfection. Stage presence comes from trying on stage, and the Maybe Talent Show is the place where this is possible for everyone. Inclusive, hilarious and without making fun of anyone. Promise.

        <abstract>Straßen aus Zucker lädt ein zur Frage: Sind linke Utopien tot – oder nötiger denn je? Spoiler: Aufgeben ist keine Option.</abstract>
        <description>Der Klimawandel. Trump, die AfD und all ihre Fans. Krieg und Terror. Die
Dauerschleife der Weltkrisen und das vermeintliche Ende der progressiven
Jugend. Die 1930er-Vibes, spürst du sie auch?

Ist das etwa das Ende linker Utopien? Rette sich, wer kann? Ruhestand
auf Keta? Nicht jetzt, nicht hier, nicht wir. Aufgeben ist keine Option.
Aber nicht deshalb, weil es schlechter Stil wäre. Sondern deshalb, weil
linke Utopien alles andere als vorbei sind. Sie sind da, sie sind nötig,
sie sind machbar.

Das linke Jugendblatt "Straßen aus Zucker" läd am Späti ein zur Frage: Wo stecken sie noch, die linken Utopien?

Hierfür haben wir ein Programm geplant, welches einen Kubernetescluster zusammen stellt und diesen Korrekt einstellt. Zusätzlich soll es eine Oberfläche geben um sich Applikationen dazu zu buchen.

Hier wird erstmal nur ein Konzept vorgestellt um auch Personen zu finden die hier mitarbeiten möchten.

        <abstract>Kultivierte Personen rezitieren Punkrock-Songtexte mit der ganzen Ernsthaftigkeit und dem dramatischen Pathos, wie sonst nur von Goethe-Abenden im Literaturhaus bekannt. Anarchie meets Bildungsbürgertum. Chaos meets Chaiselongue.</abstract>
        <description>Stell dir vor: gedämpftes Licht, ehrfürchtige Congress-Stille, vielleicht ein Glas Rotwein. Eine Mateflasche fällt um und niemand applaudiert. Sei bereit für eine Stunde voller lyrischer Hochkultur. Doch statt Rilke und Schiller erklingen die unsterblichen Verse der Kassierer – vorgetragen mit jener getragenen Feierlichkeit, die man eigentlich für Sturm und Drang reserviert.

Was passiert, wenn man "Das schlimmste ist, wenn das Bier alle ist" behandelt wie Heines "Loreley"? Wenn Strophen über Zerstörung und Rebellion plötzlich die gleiche ehrfurchtsvolle Interpretation erfahren wie Weimarer Klassik? Wir präsentieren: Die große Versöhnung zwischen Sicherheitsnadel und Smoking, zwischen Moshpit und Musensaal.

Entdecke die verborgene Poesie im Pogo, die Metaphorik im Mittelfinger, und die überraschende Erkenntnis, dass "Keine Macht für Niemand" eigentlich erstaunlich gut klingt, wenn man es ausspricht wie ein frisch ausgegrabenes Goethe-Fragment.
Hochkultur ist auch nur Punk mit besseren Manieren.

        <abstract>Klassiker des antifaschistischen Deutschpunk-Liedguts – von Die Ärzte über Die Toten Hosen bis WIZO und Terrorgruppe – neu interpretiert auf dem Akkordeon.&#13;
Laut, links und garantiert mitgröltauglich.</abstract>
        <description>Begleitet von harmonischen Akkordeonklängen stimmen wir gemeinsam antifaschistische Klassiker des deutschen Punks an, um sie stilgerecht zusammen zu grölen. Auf dem Programm stehen Songs von WIZO, Die Ärzte, Terrorgruppe und Die Toten Hosen. Es ist die perfekte Gelegenheit, sich im Kreise Gleichgesinnter den Frust über den Rechtsruck der Gesellschaft von der Seele zu schreien. Textsicherheit ist nicht nötig, für Spickzettel ist gesorgt.

Der Akkordeonspieler Pianostein machte nicht nur durch zahlreiche Gastauftritte bei Bands wie Die Toten Hosen, Sondaschule, Dritte Wahl oder Rogers von sich reden – sondern vor allem durch seine legendären Klo-Konzerte bei deren Shows. Ganz nach dem Motto: Wo Menschen zusammenkommen und eine Haltung teilen, reicht ein Akkordeon, um alle zum Grölen zu bringen und den Moment unvergesslich zu machen.

        <abstract>How does live techno work?&#13;
On the dance floor, it's practically impossible to understand what's happening up front. It's also irrelevant there, because it's all about the music and many other things.&#13;
&#13;
Live sets have a thousand faces. Everyone has their own workflow, and there are countless approaches to performing electronic music. I don't know all of them, but I will give a deeper insight into the architecture of my setup in this short presentation. I explain my approach to improvising techno in clubs and at festivals. &#13;
&#13;
There will be a few technical insights into my „Ableton“ structure. A fixed structure with an unknown outcome. Because at certain points, I rely on random generators to create the desired element of surprise. This keeps me inspired for hours, again and again. I will show and explain why I make music this way.</abstract>

        <abstract>Finally a drag show at the chaos! Blinking lights, colorful outfits, and queers everywhere already seems normal at the congress. So how can it be, that all of this did not come together as drag on stage?! It is time for a really awesome, great drag show at the 39c3!&#13;
And to show right away how divers drag is, a wonderful cast of drag artists of various genders and expressions can spread their queer joy and art for the audience.&#13;
&#13;
The show is hosted by Milky Gay, the nerdiest drag king from NRW, who does not only want to throw glitter at the congress incognito this year. And he is bringing an amazing cast with him&#13;
Bingus Bongus (Drag Queen, Hamburg)&#13;
Neuro Spicy (Drag King, NRW)&#13;
Missass Nostalgia (Drag Queen, NRW) and&#13;
Kaín Mensch (Drag Thing, Hamburg)&#13;
will bring their queer art to finally merge chaos and drag!&#13;
&#13;
Everyone is welcome, we are trying to have as little barriers as possible to come and watch. No blinking lights during the show (no guarantee for the path there and acts before and after), Music Club accessible with mobility aids and wheel chairs (ask assigned angles). Mostly standing room, few seats at the side might not allow for a good view of the show. Content notes for certain parts of the show include death, cancer, violence, fake weapons, and sexual violence, and will be announced in time so people can leave and come back afterwards. Cheering is encouraged, so it might get loud. (more details tba). Please be nice to each other and especially help short people as well as queers to find a spot where they can see enough. Also, as drag is expensive, there will be a tipping round in the end - please bring some cash if you consider tipping the artists, but of course you are also welcome either way.</abstract>

        <description>The whole Sachsentrance vibe packed in one DJ Team. With their energizing DJ presence, they always bring the dancefloor on fire. The music they play is mostly produced in the 90s and 2000s ranging from popular rave hymns to underground techno and trance tracks. Over the years they gathered a huge treasure of hits. They love to surprise with unconventional tracks and unexpected genre cuts - you will never know what comes next. However, one thing is for sure: it's gonna be a banger!

        <abstract>In my improvised live set, my random generators and I bounce ideas off each other. This approach allows previously created loops to flow into endless new combinations.</abstract>
        <description>I love loopy and trippy techno. When dancing, I like to let go of everything around me and enter a deeper dialogue with myself. At this stage, I am 100% in tune with myself. This works for me when the groove drives me and the elements I hear are interesting but not too intrusive. That’s exactly what I love to create on the dance floor.

To achieve this—and to create the necessary element of surprise—I combine different loops randomly and "blindly". Since I never know exactly what will happen, I am constantly surprised and inspired by the result.

        <abstract>Seine Sets sind geprägt von düsteren, treibenden Beats und hypnotischen Grooves, die sich perfekt für Underground-Partys und nächtliche Dancefloors eignen. Tatendrang ist kein Mainstream-DJ, sondern ein klarer Szene-DJ, der sich auf spezielle, energiegeladene Sounds konzentriert und damit eine loyale Fangemeinde anspricht. Mit viel Gespür für Atmosphäre und Spannungsaufbau nimmt er sein Publikum mit auf eine intensive musikalische Reise.</abstract>
        <description>In seinen Sets widmet sich Tatendrang.wav vor allem dem Psytrance in seinen unterschiedlichen Facetten – von tiefen, psychedelischen Klanglandschaften bis hin zu druckvollen, treibenden Passagen. Sein Fokus liegt darauf, eine dichte Atmosphäre aufzubauen, die Körper und Geist gleichermaßen in Bewegung versetzt.

Dabei geht es ihm weniger um schnelle Effekte, sondern um einen konstanten Flow, hypnotische Rhythmen und eine intensive Verbindung zum Dancefloor. Tatendrang.wav steht für authentische Underground-Vibes, kompromisslosen Sound und lange Nächte voller Energie, Psychedelic Feelings und ekstatischer Momente.

&#13;
&gt;&gt;currently hosting MUSTER show every month at @thfradio</abstract>
        <description>Born in Berlin 1996, MASCHA is a DJ and music producer, shaped by the city’s dancefloors and her deep roots in one of Berlin’s most renowned House &amp; Techno clubs. Coming from a multi-generational musician family and a background in dance, she approaches DJing as movement and storytelling, her sets unfold with precision, tension, and emotional depth, delivering a 2-hour journey into hypnotic, tribal, and distinctly 90s-rooted soundscapes. Following her live set debut with an orchestra this year, MASCHA continues to push boundaries while staying grounded in the raw essence of club culture.

In ihrer Musik kombiniert sie Elemente aus Downtempo, Experimentalmusik, Breakbeat und Oper mit eigens entwickelten Sounddesign-Techniken. Krauß veröffentlichte 2020 und 2024 die Vinylalben [Freedom/Fiction] und [After her Destruction] und performte auf diversen Bühnen, u.a.: Documenta Fifteen (Kassel), Kampnagel (Hamburg), Volkstheater (Wien), Montez-Press Radio (NYC), NAVEL (Los Angeles).</abstract>

        <abstract>Felix Kubin, funkensprühender Spannungs- und Weltenwandler aus Hamburg, Verachter der&#13;
Nüchternheit, lenkt die musikalische Kompassnagel Richtung Stolperdisko, Art Pop und „gute&#13;
Nervmusik“. Das Tanzbein zappelt, aber die Beine laufen in verschiedene Richtungen, denn sie&#13;
haben sich noch nicht synchronisiert. Hier erklingen Songs am Rande des&#13;
Nervenzusammenbruchs, "Musik für junge Leute" und alle, die nicht sterben wollen. Vor allem&#13;
haben es ihm die obskuren Musikversuche der Heimstudios vergangener Fostex-Generationen&#13;
angetan, die Art Brut und ihre Einfärbungen durch billige, leicht zu demolierende Technologien.&#13;
Felix Kubins musikalische Adoleszenz wurde durch eine Zeit geprägt, in der sich die Szenen der&#13;
Kunst und Musik stark durchdrangen und Songtitel wie "Die Gesunden kommen", "Adrenalin&#13;
lässt das Blut kochen" und "Hosen, die nicht aneinander passen" kein Stirnrunzeln&#13;
verursachten. Eine Zeit also, in der sich die Popmusik weit aus dem Fenster lehnte und die Luft&#13;
einer fremden, seltsamen Welt atmete.</abstract>

        <description>How does a detachable cable car actually work?

I've been fascinated by these mechanical giants for a long time and have been working on implementing this technology as a working model. I've brought along the first prototypes to show you!

In this short talk, I'd like to show you what's needed to clamp onto a cable and how to develop such a detachable clamp.

Required prior knowledge: What a clothespin is

        <description>At several Chaos events, you can often spot a cheerful group of people playing the game “Joustmania” ( https://github.com/adangert/JoustMania ).

In this game, each player holds a PlayStation Move controller that tracks the player’s movement.
As soon as a controller accelerates too quickly, the player is eliminated from the game.
The competitors therefore try to defeat each other by bumping or nudging the other players’ controllers, forcing them to move too fast.

This year, I decided to rebuild the game myself and ran into quite a few obstacles along the way: from sourcing the hardware, to setting up a Raspberry Pi (the game is already about 10 years old), all the way to compiling Bluetooth drivers. In the end, this even resulted in my own fork of the project: https://github.com/VanFanelia/joustmania-remastered

In this session, I would like to share what I’ve learned, answer your questions about the game or rebuilding it, and/or organize a few rounds of play.

        <description>“[Who's speaking?](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn23-213-lanzmining-wer-spricht-denn-da-),” asked arrrrrmin at GPN23. But finding out who speaks how often on talk shows, etc., takes weeks.

But why has no one structured this flood of videos and podcasts yet? Especially now that AI slop is permeating all media, it's becoming increasingly difficult to figure out what's behind what you're hearing.

If you, like arrrrrmin, are looking for answers, the WissKomm Wiki is for you. The project has been in planning since 2021 and will officially launch in 2026 to make videos and podcasts more accessible and understandable for everyone in many workshops like this one. If you want to know more about videos and podcasts, check out the [video at C3PB](https://c3pb.de/blog/vorstellung-der-idee-des-wisskomm-wikis.html), take a look at the [project website](https://borgnetzwerk.org/wisskomm-wiki-2026), but most importantly:

Come to the 39C3 talk :)

We look forward to seeing you!

_The talk will be followed by a [workshop](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/digitale-infrastruktur-fur-videos-und-podcasts-wis) the next day, where we can discuss all questions and ideas in detail ;)_

        <description>These days, the EU border regimes are at the same time increasingly digitalized and repressive. Border "security" and surveillance experience a revival fuelled by technological development and the authoritarian as well as right-wing political turn. Both the EU and Frontex invest billions in border surveillance and research on border technologies trying to to formulate how (border) technologies such as drones are to be used in the future. Simultaneously and despite increasing criminalisation, border activists are working on tech-from-below-drones to safe lives, support people on the move in distress and campaign for a future where freedom of movement is in fact everybody's right.

In an interactive workshop, we want to investigate the usage of drones at the EU extrenal borders. Most border technologies are developed and deployed by abled-bodied white cis-endo men. By putting our heads together, we want to queer these drones collectively:
- How can we get from re-action to action?
- Where are blind spots? Which perspectives are missing?
- What should be made visible, what might better stay invisible?
- What does queering of (border) technology mean? How can a queering of border technologies look like?

Please note:
* This workshop will be held in English.
  *No prior knowledge on drones or EU border politics required.
* Trigger Warning: We are focussing on border technologies, but related issues such as flight, violence or specific politics *might* come up in group work or disuccions. Please take care of yourself :-)
* Age is a fluid concept, but to make it graspable: The participation in the workshop might be more fulfulling if you are 16 years or older. But: Read the description, check the trigger warning and then decide on your own.

        <description>systemd offers lots of low-effort features for hardening services, but they're only slowly gaining adoption even though they are relatively simple to use. I'd like to introduce the essential options for hardening a systemd service, taking into account some interesting possibilities that arise when at least parts of the system are completely immutable, such as on NixOS.

        <description>Quadball combines the best of rugby, handball, and dodgeball -- let's talk about that!
It looks like this -&gt; [https://chaos.social/@saxnot/115754026830564736](https://chaos.social/@saxnot/115754026830564736)

Again we will present Quadball (Muggle Quidditch) at congress! Very small intro to the sport rules followed by casual Q&amp;A.

Quadball champions gender diversity with its gender rule:
"A team may not have more than three players who identify as the same gender in play at the same time"
giving an edge to nonbinary players.

Jendrik and saxnot play in the Braunschweiger Broomicorns, one of the leading german quadball teams.

        <title>Wondrous mathematics: How does artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT accomplish the feat of learning?</title>

        <description>Conventional computer algorithms are superior to the human intellect in many regards: for instance at multiplying large numbers or winning at chess by analyzing huge numbers of moves. But there are also many tasks which come naturally to us yet exceed the capabilities of algorithms by vast amounts: Rigid algorithms can't decipher human handwriting or drive cars.

The recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence circumvent these barriers by employing quite a different approach: They use artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the partially-understood way the human brain works.

The unique feature of artificial neural nets is that they aren't rigid, but can learn. Human programmers specify their rough structure and supply training data, but don't write a single line of code governing their behavior.

**In the spirit of a good Unix command-line tool, this talk aspires to explain one thing and explain it well: How do artificial neural nets accomplish the feat of learning?**

We'll learn that the answer is related to a mathematical breakthrough made at the end of the 17th century and discuss why deep learning only surged in the last few years, even though the basics of artificial neural nets were already understood in the 1980s. We'll also touch upon some of the greatest problems of neural nets, which emerge directly from the way neural nets learn.

The talk doesn't require any advanced knowledge of mathematics. If you're already familiar with Michael Nielsen's book, then don't expect to learn anything new and come to this talk only if you want to contribute interesting remarks. The talk has the goal of making the other neural network talks more accessible.

        <description>Waldbesetzungen entstehen dort, wo Wälder trotz sich verschärfender Klimakrise weiter abgeholzt werden. Sie sind eine direkte Form, sich der Zerstörung der Profitgier des Kapitalismus in den Weg zu stellen. Gleichzeitig sind sie Utopieschmieden, an denen Menschen aus unterschiedlichen Kontexten zusammenkommen, um zu erproben, wie eine solidarische, klimagerechte Zukunft aussehen könnte.

Im Altdorfer Wald (bei Ravensburg) leben wir seit Februar 2021. Wir kämpfen gegen die Zerstörung und Ausbeutung des Bodens durch einen örtlichen Kiesbaron. Der Kiesabbau ermöglicht das Bauen mit klimaschädlichem Beton und das Versiegeln von immer mehr Naturflächen.

        <description>Myonen-Detektion mit einer Funkenkammer. Wie funktioniert das eigentlich?

Myonen sind Teilchen, die Elektronen sehr ähnlich sind, nur deutlich schwerer. Sie entstehen in der kosmischen Hintergrundstrahlung und treffen ständig auf die Erde. Eine praktische Eigenschaft dieser Teilchen ist, dass sie beim Durchqueren von Materie, Moleküle ionisieren. Auf ihrem Weg hinterlassen sie also Spuren aus freien Elektronen.

In einer Funkenkammer macht man sich genau diesen Effekt zunutze: Zwischen zwei Elektroden liegt ein starkes elektrisches Feld an. Wenn ein vorbeifliegendes Myon ein Gas ionisiert, werden die frei gewordenen Elektronen im Feld beschleunigt und lösen einen sichtbaren Funken aus. So wird die unsichtbare Spur des Myons kurzzeitig sichtbar.

Wie kann man wissen, ob das detektierte Teilchen ein Myon ist? Welche technischen Herausforderungen gibt es? Wie nützlich ist eine Funkenkammer heutzutage noch? Inwiefern gibt es Überschneidungen mit Teilchendetektoren am DESY oder CERN? Das alles versuche ich zu beantworten.

Beim 38c3 habe ich bereits einen Vortrag mit dem Titel „Einführung in die Teilchenphysik“ gehalten. Seitdem habe ich viel dazugelernt und freue mich darauf, dieses Wissen mit euch zu teilen, mit euch in den Austausch zu gehen und euch auf meinem Weg zur angehenden Teilchenphysikerin mitzunehmen.

Der Vortrag ist für alle Lebewesen gedacht. Egal ob ihr Vorwissen mitbringt oder nicht.

Ich freue mich auf euer Kommen!

        <description>This is a beginners' workshop on web application security. No prerequisites in web application security are required. A certain (web application) development background is beneficial.

First, we will be playing a virtual escape the room game with challenges on a web application to get into an attacker's mindset.
Then follows a quick introduction to the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (2025 Release Candidate).
Finally use the gathered knowledge to attack a vulnerable web application (https://github.com/Phylu/vulnerable-click-game) and see how these attacks can easily be prevented.

Please bring your (fully charged) laptop to be able to participate.

We created a space to do the kind of research we've always wanted, but couldn't do at our local hackerspaces - either due to space constraints, or lack of structures allowing for a safe operation of a proper lab.

        <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. Alongside their vast potential, these models also present unique security challenges. This session will serve as a primer on LLM security and secure LLMOps, introducing key issues and concepts related to the security of LLMs and systems relying on them. For example, we will be looking at issues such as prompt injection, sensitive information disclosure, and issues related to the interaction of LLMs with the “outside world” (e.g., plugins or APIs, RAG, Agentic AI). Of course, we are also going to briefly look at how to red-team LLMs.

This session is based on previous iterations of “A Primer on LLM Security” at Congress and, based on audience feedback, has been extended and developed further.


This session is based on previous iterations of “A Primer on LLM Security” at Congress and, based on audience feedback, has been extended and developed further.

## Target Audience and Required Previous Knowledge

This session targets beginners and does not assume (in-depth) knowledge about LLMs. If you have prior experience in LLM security and anticipate insights into the latest developments, this session most likely is not for you.
Please note that this session will not be about using LLMs in offensive or defensive cybersecurity.

## Learning Objectives

From a learning perspective, after the session, participants will be able to …

* describe what LLMs are and how they fundamentally function.
* describe LLMOps and outline fundamental principles of secure LLMOps.
* describe common security issues related to LLMs and systems relying on LLMs.
* describe what LLM red teaming is.
* perform some basic attacks against LLMs to test them for common issues.

## About Me

My Name is Ingo, and I am currently responsible for Digital Education and Educational Technology at the University of Cologne. Relevant to this session, I have a background in computational linguistics and have been working with LLMs for quite some time – also prior to the ChatGPT moment. I am also involved in developing and providing AI infrastructure at scale. Of course, all of this is embedded within a deep interest in cyber- and information security.

## Format
The session will be split into a 45-minute talk as well as 15 minutes of discussion. Participants will be provided with the slides as well as some resources for further study.

## Technical Requirements
As this will not be a highly hands-on session, there are no technical requirements. If you want to experiment with some of the topics, a device capable of accessing and/or running LLMs is necessary. If you want to “go deeper,” you will need a device – e.g., a laptop, capable of running LLMs locally.

## Material

After the session, I will provide all materials, including some selected additional resources. All materials will also be provided via this page.

Ps. This is a slightly updated version of the workshop(s) I gave at previous iterations of Congress.

        <description>We've been working on Teamtype (previously known as Ethersync) for two years now: It connects directories on different computers together, and keeps them in sync. And if you open a file in your text editor, you can edit it together, and see each other's cursors.

This enables a new form of smooth real-time collaboration. You can use it for pair programming or note-taking, for example, all from the comfort of your own editor! It feels a bit like the missing real-time complement to Git.

Teamtype follows local-first principles, and uses encrypted peer-to-peer connections (you don't need a server or an account). You can also work on entire projects, not just single files.

At 39C3, it's time for a live demo! Let me show you how Teamtype works and what you can do with it! We're maintaining plugins for Neovim and VS Code/Codium; others are working on plugins for Jetbrains IDEs, have integrated it into TeXstudio, or are building a web editor for it! I can also show you some more experimental features like a Hedgedoc bridge, or writing commit messages together.

We'd be excited for more collaboration on collaboration, so let me show you how to get involved!

In the final part of this session, you can install &amp; try Teamtype for yourself in a frantic massively-multiplayer editing experiment! :D

        <description>Fusion is always 30 years in the future because government projects are too big, too expensive, and too slow. It doesn't have to be this way.

There are better approaches than the three known research directions. There are better fusion fuels that don't cause radioactive contamination. Fusion has even been achieved by school classes and private individuals. A proof that it is possible with much less effort.

If we invested as much money in proton-boron fusion as we do in deuterium-tritium, we would probably have power plants in 15 years. Dense Plasma Focus is suitable for decentralized 10-MW power plants. Inertial Electrostatic Confinement for neighborhood power plants with 100 MW. This is not about cold fusion. It's about fusing atomic nuclei with high energy (hot) to gain even more energy. But in different physical configurations. Unfortunately, the media ignores these other hot fusion approaches.

This is an info dump on the state of the art: what fusion fuels exist, how you build your own fusion reactor, why hot plasma is physically unfavorable, why some people want to strip-mine the moon, and why other fusion projects that must make do with 100 times less money still achieve similar performance. These projects don't appear in the mainstream press. But they will soon overtake ITER.


If we want to achieve the energy transition, then policymakers must stop investing in supposedly safe large-scale technology. It could be much faster and cheaper and the new energy grid could be decentralized.

        <description>If you're trying to raise your privacy / OPSEC in the real and digital worlds to a maximum, this is for you.

This is a round-table skill sharing session about practical privacy.
Let's discuss our threat levels (what we're trying to protect against) and share our approaches to preserving our privacy.

Topics may include how to avoid unique identifiers like your legal or birth name, phone numbers, email addresses, physical (postal) addresses, device identifiers like browser cookies, IP addresses, MAC addresses, anonymous/multiple SIM cards or virtual phone numbers, and all kinds of fingerprinting techniques.

I will bring a list of topics/threats and we'll discuss our solutions to them. I'm asking to share your tricks, which may include using fake names, P.O. boxes and parcel lockers, actively avoiding cameras, using anonymous phone numbers / SIM cards, VPNs, browser extensions, sandboxing techniques, self hosting, and whatever else. Of course I'll bring my knowledge on this topic as well.

The session will not be recorded. Please do not take any photos.

        <description>In Science Fiction gibt es Überlichtgeschwindigkeit, Aliens, Antigravitation, Terraforming, Schutzschilde, Beamen, Railguns, KI, Fusion, Nano, und noch viel mehr.

Dieser Vortrag gibt einen Überblick, was die moderne Wissenschaft dazu sagt. Der Stand der Wissenschaft entwickelt sich weiter und das kommt nur langsam in der Science Fiction Literatur und in der Öffentlichkeit an. Was stimmt noch und was hat sich geändert? Was ist wissenschaftlich fundiert, was wäre vielleicht doch möglich und was wird immer erfundene Wissenschaft bleiben.

Ein realistischer Blick auf die Technologien von Star Trek und Star Wars. Außerdem ein Blick über den Tellerrand, denn auch in der Vergangenheit wurden ab und zu schon Technologien erfunden, die sich vorher niemand vorstellen konnte.

        <description>Data literacy and digitalisation are crucial topics in today's research institutions, to tackle global challenges like climate change, the dramatic loss of species and the erosion of democracy. Nevertheless, most research data is not digitalised nor back-uped; reproducible &amp; transparent research is often a dream.
In Research Data Management, a lot of guidlines exist to face these difficulties: Data Management Plans, FAIR data, ELSA, etc. It seems like there is a strategy and buzzword for every problem.

**But what is missing is a discussion, if these strategies are inclusive (for neurodivergent people).** How can we alter them, what is needed for you to apply them?

I would love to **discuss** with you about your experiences in digitalisation in research institutions &amp; universities and hear about your experiences to raise awareness in the research data community.

About the Speaker:
While working as a Data Scientist at the Data Science Center (BMFTR founded Data Nord Project @ University of Bremen) and beeing neurodivergent myself, I have faced a lot of not inclusive strategies and would love to change the current situation.

        <description>The hearing aid space is antiquated and overpriced and badly in need of a widely available and easy to use open source alternative. 5 manufacturers control 99% of the global market, and have little incentive to innovate or compete on prices, so hearing aids cost thousands of Euros. Everyone we meet has either themselves or through a loved one had a bad experience with hearing aids, or experienced quality of life issues with hearing loss.

We've been working on making an alternative with our knowledge of professional audio technology, which has long outpaced the medical hearing aid realm. We want to both share the journey, and learn about your experiences both with the technology and hearing itself.

        <description>Meeting of creatures who have already tinkered with search engines, for getting to know each other and exchanging knowledge.

If you are interested in search engines, but have no prior knowledge [Search engines for the Curious](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/search-engines-for-the-curious) on day 3 is the even t for you.

Bring
* problems where you are curious how others solved them
* solutions others may be interested in
* Lots of curiousness
* some time to chat and listen

If you are curious about how search engines work but haven't worked on one yet you might be interested in the session "Search Engines for the Curious" which is aimed to be accessible to newcomers.

Exact location are still to be announced.

Note: SoS Workshop D is way too large, I'd be happy to free up the reservation in exchange for a small location (maybe ~20 people) (and maybe a 50min slot)

        <description>**A heartfelt welcome!**

We will hold a Rust workshop for beginners.

We will start with an introduction in the form of a lecture of about 45 minutes.

This will be followed by a period of about 120 minutes (including a break), during which you are going to work through exercises independently and at your own pace.

We will help with any questions. We — and you — will be supported by the automated Rustlings course.

Other experienced Rust developers will be on hand to help all participants directly with questions during the workshop.

Don't hold back: You are very welcome to ask questions during the workshop!

**You will need:**

- A laptop, prepared as described below, so we can get started right away.

**Preparation**

- Follow the instructions at **&lt;https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/&gt;** for the installation of Rust itself, as well as the interactive Rustlings course.
- Also note the instructions for the editor and terminal. The integration with [**rust-analyzer**](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) will make your Rust experience much more enjoyable!

**Verify that your setup works ahead of time!**

If you would like to receive help setting this up or verifying that your setup works well (especially if you use Windows), please come by our friendly Rust assembly or contact me directly.

**Power supply**

The workshop rooms at the venue are not well prepared for work with many laptops: unfortunately, there will not be any power sockets at the tables!

- Please bring your laptop fully charged.
- If you can, then bring a long cable and multi-sockets, so you can provide yourself and others with electricity.

**See you at the workshop — great to have you!**

        <description>KinkyGeeks and RopeLabs join forces to host a follow up Beginner Bondage Workshop.

Instructors [@DoodleMe](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/DoodleMe) and [@KnottyLola](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/KnottyLola) explore next steps in Japanese rope bondage. 18+ lab-mode workshop. Bring rope and a blanket if you have them. Attendance at the beginner class helps but is not required.

This workshop expands on theory and knots from the beginner class and moves at a faster pace. We will briefly recap key skills such as single and double column ties, then progress from there.

This session suits those with some rope experience or those who attended the introductory workshop. You do not need to have taken Part I, but you should be comfortable with basic rope handling.

The workshop runs in lab mode. It is fully clothed, non-sexual, and open to participants aged 18 and over only.

Singles, pairs, and groups are welcome. Space is limited by the room size.

Please bring your own non-stretch rope if you have it, plus a blanket or cushion for sitting on the floor. Avoid loose clothing where possible. The workshop will be taught in English.

Places are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person.

        <description>(Workshop will be primarily in German and the introduction will be in German. However, most of the interaction will happen between you, your computer and maybe the person(s) next to you, so non-German-speaker should also be able to participate. I will walk around and can answer questions in English.)

In this interactive workshop, you will hunt for widespread vulnerabilities from the popular category “Broken Access Control.” In a specially designed cyber range, you will be challenged to detect and exploit security gaps and understand the dangers posed by inadequately secured access points.

Afterwards, we will work together to develop solutions that will help you avoid such vulnerabilities in the future and ensure the security of your applications.

Target group: Developers (at least hobbyists) with no particular connection to IT security.

Technical requirements: You have used websites before. You can read simple code.

Technical requirements: Laptop with internet access (shared with another person if necessary). Firefox(!)-Browser (no Chrome, no Safari, no Edge).

        <description>Cybersecurity Märchen XXL – New and Old Stories from Nerdistan

This session ist held in german

I’m mitBen, and with over 25 years of experience as a Cybersecurity expert, I invite you to a very special journey into the world of digital security – in an exclusive XXL Night Session. In this extended session, I will read fairy tales from last year and perhaps even some that didn’t make it into the daytime session. We’ll experience familiar tales like The Seven Little Goats and Puss in Boots in a new light, while also diving even deeper into the secrets of cybersecurity.

The XXL Night Session will take place in an abandoned room, providing the perfect atmosphere for a deeper journey through Nerdistan. This session is your chance to immerse yourself more intensively into the world of cybersecurity. With a relaxed yet thrilling vibe, it’s designed for all the night owls out there.

The day session the day before can be found here:

        <description>Eine weitere Verlängerung der Congress-P&amp;P-Night. Anderer Raum als die anderen, was dran liegt, dass wir ursprünglich als zwei Menschen unabhängig voneinander eine P&amp;P-Night angemeldet haben und das dann gemerkt und zusammen gelegt haben. Und Raum und Zeit lässt sich nicht trivial ändern, weil dieses Jahr Nacht-Sessions nur noch von der Orga angelegt werden können. Egal, wird schon, Nachts ist ja eigentlich überall genug Platz.

        <description>We welcome all interested FLINTA (women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, agender) who want to learn more about the Haecksen to this picnic. 
We are looking forward to all individuals, regardless of whether they have an IT background or come from a completely different field of interest.

You are also welcome to use this picnic as an opportunity to join the Haecksen and meet like-minded creatures near you.

If you are already a Haeckse, please attend the [traditional Haecksen picnic](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/haecksen-picknick-fur-alt-haecksen_i0dn) on Day 3 at 3 p.m. instead to get to know more Haecksen.

Note: Due to the high level of interest in 37C3 and 38C3, this event will also take place outside of the Haecksen Assembly this year.

        <description>CN: Suicide / Mental Health

Depression is widespread—and within the Chaos community, the number of entities struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts is alarmingly high. The painful suicides of the past year, particularly within the trans community, have clearly shown us: We urgently need better structures for mental health and crisis intervention, as well as practical advice for the community on how to support one another. In this session, we want to take action. We will gather initial ideas and approaches: How can we effectively support beings with suicidal thoughts? How do we protect ourselves from burnout? What good resources do we already know and can share with each other? Which ressources are still missing? Together, we will exchange ideas in small groups for a safer, more supportive environment. We will share these results at the end of the session and make them available to the wider community afterwards.

A meetup initiated by CCCHH, The Spectrum, Safe the Dance &amp; F.U.C.K.

        <description>Chaos Communication Congress (C3) is a major annual gathering for people passionate about technology, cybersecurity, free culture, and creativity. Since 1984, it has taken place in Germany and initially used mostly German, then English to facilitate international communication.

Today, thanks to International Sign (IS), everyone—deaf or hearing—can fully participate. IS makes exchanges open, accessible, and equal, allowing people to overcome language barriers and collaborate easily.

Did you know there are over 300 sign languages in the world, some existing for more than 5,000 years? IS has been used for several decades by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and the Deaflympics Games (ICSD). Traditionally, these organizations imposed a hierarchy, but today IS allows a holarchy, where everyone has a place and communication is shared and equal.

A big question arises: why choose English instead of International Sign? English was adopted to facilitate communication among hearing participants worldwide. But International Sign allows us to connect deaf and hearing people in a more universal way, opening a space for equal sharing and helping to prevent ignorance about deaf cultures and their languages.

At 39C3, IS helps connect diverse cultures: hack, free, maker, and deaf, fostering creativity, collaboration, and innovation.

Our project, Nest of Sign Language at House of Tea, offers workshops where participants can practice International Sign (IS), German Sign Language (DGS), Austrian Sign Language (OGS), French Sign Language (LSF), British Sign Language (BSL), American Sign Language (ASL), and more, as well as create, share, and connect in a friendly and inspiring environment. Some IS interpreters are certified, but will they be present at 40C3? Conferences and workshops become opportunities to learn, share, and dream together, regardless of language or background.

        <description>Von Jura-Studis über Rechtsanwältinnen und Rechtsanwälten bis zu Jura-Profs sind alle Jurist:innen i.w.S. eingeladen, sich gegenseitig in lockerer Runde kennenzulernen und zu vernetzen.

Die verfügbaren Räume auf dem Congress sind knapp. Daher haben wir im SOS 6 nur 25 Minuten. Es wird vorgeschlagenen, ab 12 Uhr für weitere Gespräche in die Nähe des c3Späti weiterzuziehen (genauer Treffpunkt: Bottle Drop Point 73 am Geländer, direkt gegenüber der Chaos Post, in Blickweite des c3Späti).

Der einladende Dickmaulrüssler ist Rechtsanwalt in Hamburg.

        <description>We would like to invite all queer individuals interested in queer digital infrastructure ("it by us for us as queers") to meet with us and build a collective/community.

Whether you develop software solutions, design IT infrastructure, or are simply looking for technical solutions that are suitable for us as queers and that we can trust—you are very welcome 💖!

Even if you just want to meet other queer people at the Congress, feel free to come by.

🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

“We” are the loose collective [queerit.org](https://queerit.org), the [Digital Empowerment Project by Local IT](https://digitalempowermentproject.de/) together with the ["queersupport" of the youth network Lambda](https://queersupport.de).

Let's build on what we already discussed as QueerIT at the Chaos Feminist Convention (you can see what that was [here](https://queerit.org/queer-it-auf-der-chaos-feminist-convention/)) and form alliances.

We look forward to seeing you!

        <description>Hey you! Psst, are you a developer or an IT person? Do you use multiple computers with many packages and move between them back and forth?
I feel your pain and may have some remedy for it. You don't have to sell your soul to get out of dependency hell, BTW ;-) I will show you how to embrace the Functional Programming Model even at the operating system level! Eelco Dolstra explored these ideas in his PhD thesis in 2006, also introducing NixOS. Today we focus on GNU Guix, inspired by NixOS Ludovic Courtès started this lispy project in 2012.

        <abstract>Dies ist die Hands-on-Session zum Talk "CPU-Entwicklung in Factorio: Vom D-Flip-Flop bis zum eigenen Betriebssystem"&#13;
Am besten schaut ihr euch vorher den Talk an, dort wird das Projekt ausführlich vorgestellt.</abstract>
        <description>Dies ist die Hands-on-Session zum Talk "CPU-Entwicklung in Factorio: Vom D-Flip-Flop bis zum eigenen Betriebssystem"
(https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/cpu-entwicklung-in-factorio-vom-d-flip-flop-bis-zum-eigenen-betriebssystem).

In dieser Session zeige ich, wie man meine CPU in Factorio lädt, wie man
Assembly-Programme dafür schreibt, sie assembliert und schließlich in
Factorio ausführt.

Zum Mitmachen solltet ihr **Factorio** bereits installiert haben
(Grundspiel, nicht die Erweiterung *Space Age*).
Getestet habe ich Factorio über Steam auf Windows und Ubuntu (mit Proton
10.0; Guide für Linux-Installation von Steam-Games:
https://ubuntu.com/blog/linux-gaming-with-ubuntu-desktop-steam-and-proton).
Ohne Factorio könnt ihr eure Assembly-Programme nur auf einem
Python-Simulator ausführen.
*(Factorio ist übrigens generell ein sehr gutes Spiel, das ich
uneingeschränkt empfehlen kann …)*

Für den Assembler benötigt ihr eine Python-Umgebung und müsst ein
GitHub-Repository clonen.
Für die Bedienung in Factorio empfehle ich außerdem eine Maus, auch wenn
sie nicht zwingend notwendig ist.

Im Detail werden wir:

- Den Factorio-Worldsave meiner CPU in Factorio öffnen
- Alle benötigten Quality-of-Life-Mods installieren
- Die vorinstallierten Programme auf der CPU testen
- Das Assembler-Repository clonen und den Python-Assembler einrichten
- RISC-V-Assembly kennenlernen
- Ein erstes kleines Programm schreiben
- Das Programm assemblieren
- Den Blueprint in Factorio laden
- Das eigene Programm in Factorio ausführen!

Ich freue mich sehr über Anregungen und Fragen.
Wenn beispielsweise jemand Interesse hätte, für diese CPU einen Compiler
zu bauen, wäre ich ganz Ohr! :)

        <description>The reading will be held in German.

I’m mitBen, and for over 25 years, I’ve been working as a Cybersecurity expert to make the world a safer place. As a speaker, I’m here today to take you on a journey where classic fairy tales like The Seven Little Goats and Puss in Boots are brought into the digital realm. In "Cybersecurity Märchen – Neues aus Nerdistan", I’ll teach you the fundamentals of IT security in a fun and nerdy way – all without the dry theory.

Imagine this: the seven little goats need to protect themselves from a hacking wolf. Puss in Boots becomes a cybersecurity pro and shows us how he defends his system with clever tricks. In these and many other stories, I’ll take you on an adventure where you’ll learn important security lessons – all wrapped up in fairy tales you’ve never heard before.

With my 25 years of experience in cybersecurity and as an experienced speaker, I will provide you with everything you need to know about digital security. It’s not just about making complex topics understandable – it’s about getting you excited for the digital world, with a pinch of humor and fantasy.

I’m also working on organizing an XXL Night Session, where we can dive even deeper into the mysteries of cybersecurity. In this special extended session, you’ll get even more fairy tales, plenty of stories from last year, and expanded insights into the world of digital security – guaranteed to be thrilling and educational.

        <description>In this workshop, we will program a gate-based quantum computer provided by IBM. After a short introduction to quantum physics (only the stuff we need for programming), we’ll jump right in:

We will program three small examples on IBM’s freely accessible Quantum platform, illustrating both the limitations and the potential of quantum computers.

The workshop is suitable for absolute beginners — no prior knowledge of any programming language is required.

After the workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how such a machine works - and whether we really need to start worrying about Q-Day already.
Please bring your laptop. You can sign up for IBM Quantum in advance (https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), but it’s also possible to participate without an account using the quantum simulator.

        <description>The system of harassing payment cards for people receiving asylum seeker benefits is not a new idea, but has been dusted off from the 1990s/2000s. But even back then, there was resistance—including in Thuringia!

We are showing “Change?! – No way!”, a 25-minute documentary by Filmpirat*innen about the voucher system for refugees. Using hidden cameras, the film pirates in Thuringia accompanied refugees while shopping to show the everyday, discriminatory madness at supermarket checkouts when vouchers have to be “used up” during a shopping trip or dictionaries “can't be bought with vouchers.” But they also show the everyday solidarity of people who exchange vouchers 1:1 for cash in exchange initiatives and do not stop there, but generally demand the abolition of the voucher practice – the precursor to today's payment cards.

        <description>We constantly build, use, maintain, adapt, physical and digital tools and infrastructures — both inside and outside formal institutions and far beyond classical environmental citizen science.
This session invites participants with community project(s) to share concrete user stories about how they actually work: what they try to do, what doesn't work, what they avoid using, what they need, and why.
Rather than presenting solutions or pitching an infrastructure, the session focuses on:

lived practices and workflows
Shared experiences, bottlenecks while maintaining infrastructure
Shared experiences of research activities within the community and success stories
trust issues and refusal with infrastructure services
boundaries around data, governance, and centralisation and project examples
Participants will fill in short user stories based on real situations. These stories will be anonymised and used to identify patterns that can inform the early design of a future research infrastructure (RIECS), before assumptions harden into technical or governance choices.

        <description>The initiative “No to Payment Cards Leipzig” organizes the solidarity-based voucher exchange with the help of the open source app Couponexpress. The app is freely available on codeberg.org and comes with instructions for use. The app is only used within the group to manage an ordering system for vouchers. With the help of the app, voucher orders from solidarity buyers can be matched with the vouchers actually available after an exchange, and the distribution to be made can be calculated. Without the app, the now large number of vouchers to be distributed would no longer be manageable, and it would not be possible to help so many people obtain more cash to circumvent the discriminatory payment card system.

In the SoS, the app is presented by people from the Leipzig initiative and its use is explained.

Overstimulated brains, conference survivors, and anyone needing 15 minutes of instant clarity.
Format:
Guided Micro-Practice (max. 15 minutes, no talking, just doing).
Detail:
The C3 is an intense sensory overload. This session provides a fast, scientifically grounded reset. We use sound resonance (the 'Om') not for esoteric purposes, but as a focused breathing tool for immediate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Learn how to calm your vagus nerve in under 10 minutes to restore mental clarity and focus. No spiritual content, no prerequisites—just pure pragmatism.

        <description>Während wir uns auf dem 37C3 noch begeistert Aktionsstrategien der Hongkonger Demokratiebewegung abgeguckt haben, sind mittlerweile eine halbe Million HongkongerInnen ausgewandert, geflohen, oder im Knast. Seit dem Niederschlagen des Aufstands und der Installation des Nationalen Sicherheitsgesetzes hört man aus der Stadt nicht mehr viel. Wer ist da noch? Wie weit ist ein chinesischer Überwachungsstaat installiert? Und wie gehen Menschen mit der neuen Wirklichkeit um? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, bin ich für ein halbes Jahr nach Hongkong gezogen. Das Buch „nach der Revolte“ (Alibri Verlag, Februar 2026) bietet Einblicke in die politische Gegenwart vor Ort, durch Gespräche mit HongkongerInnen, dem Nachzeichnen der technopolitischen Veränderungen der letzten Jahre, und dem Beschreiben von Alltag in einer Stadt, die so tut, als sei gar nichts passiert. Das Ganze ergibt ein Bild – von Resilienz und Ohnmacht, und von der Fragilität von Systemen, in denen schon ein, zwei Updates reichen, um eine Gesellschaft gänzlich zu ändern.

„Im Film La Haine wird die Geschichte eines Mannes erzählt, der aus dem 50. Stock fällt und sich dabei immer wieder sagt: Bis hierher lief’s noch ganz gut. Das sind wir, wenn wir denken, dass unsere Gesellschaftsordnung grundsätzlich eine ist, die unsere politischen Freiheiten hält. Das Gegenteil ist der Fall. Nichts an dieser Ordnung schützt sie, außer die temporäre, arrogante Blindheit vor dem eigenen Aufprall.“

You install Rayhunter on a LTE pocket router to detect suspicious activity from IMSI catchers (aka. Stingray) in your vicinity.

In this session we want to install Rayhunter, talk about what it does and why it is useful, what possible use cases are and how future development might look like.

Everyone is welcome, no special knowledge or skills are needed.

If you can please bring along the following items

* your laptop (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
* a (fully charged) TP-Link M7350 portable LTE router (some other models are also supported by Rayhunter, but this is the one I tested)
* a Micro-SD card (32 GB is ok)
* a SIM card (e.g. a prepaid SIM from your local supermarket - you may want to activate it but it is not strictly needed, nano-SIM form factor needed)
* a USB-C cable that can connect to your laptop
* installer files for your OS version

You can find the TP-Link M7350 used on eBay or new on Amazon for ~45 EUR

        <description>The Euclidean Sequencer is a hardware gadget developed by students from Cologne. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, thereby creating a sequence. The sequence can be modified using two potentiometers and can be connected to another sequencer or external devices, such as speakers.

        <description>In mehreren Bundesländern wurden Anträge auf Anerkennung von Bildungsurlaub abgelehnt.
Die formalen Ablehnungen landen zwar bei einzelnen – die Konsequenz betrifft jedoch alle:

Arbeitnehmende aus diesen Bundesländern können für entsprechende Veranstaltungen keinen Bildungsurlaub einreichen.

In dieser Self-organized Session wollen wir genau hier ansetzen und gemeinsam:
- Ablehnungsgründe sammeln und systematisch analysieren
- typische Argumentationsmuster der Behörden identifizieren
- überlegen, wie man diese Hürden konstruktiv und kreativ „hacken“ kann
- Ansätze entwickeln, um Inhalte, Struktur oder Sprache so anzupassen,
  dass Anerkennung künftig wahrscheinlicher wird

Ziel ist kein Frustabbau, sondern kollektives Problemlösen:

Erfahrungen bündeln, Wissen teilen und konkrete Ideen entwickeln,
wie wir Bildungsurlaub auch unter schwierigen Rahmenbedingungen möglich machen.

Die Session ist offen gestaltet – bringt gern Ideen, Perspektiven oder einfach Neugier mit.

        <description>The number of house searches, surveillance, and intimidation methods used by Saxon authorities in particular, such as SOKO Linx, in recent years is simply immeasurable. 
We would like to give you an overview of the proceedings to date and those currently underway. What investigative methods does paragraph 129 allows? Who are the Nazis, anyway? And why is solidarity important when Trump wants to destroy “Antifa”?

        <description>We want to get together, talk about our experiences with Ink/Stitch and machine embroidery, show off projects and network.

There is no agenda, we'll just sit down together and see what we feel like talking about.

Ink/Stitch is a plugin for Inkscape that can be used to design embroidery patterns for machine embroidery.

Time and place might change, please come back at 16:00 on Day 1 to confirm!

        <description>Der 19. April 2023 war für die anarchistische und antiautoritäre Bewegung ein schwerer Schlag. Drei Aktivist\*innen wurden an der Front in der Ukraine in einem Hinterhalt getötet: Dmitri Petrow aus Russland, Finbar Cafferkey aus Irland und Cooper Andrews aus den USA. Am 9. September wäre Dimas Geburtstag und zu diesem Anlass haben wir die Broschüre „Dmitry Petrow“, die 2023 von CrimethInc veröffentlicht wurde, ins Deutsche übersetzt, um weitere Texte ergänzt und aktualisiert. In seinem letzten Brief schrieb Cooper, dass der Krieg vermutlich nicht so schnell vorbei sein wird, und er behielt recht. Die Hoffnung auf ein baldiges Ende ist verschwunden. Die Folgen des Krieges, wenn er doch irgendwann zu Ende sein wird, die physische und psychische Zerstörung der ukrainischen Gesellschaft im Allgemeinen und der anarchistischen Bewegung im Besonderen sind unvorstellbar. Wir möchten mit euch gemeinsam an die erinnern, die nicht mehr mit uns sind. Wir werden bei dieser Veranstaltung aus dem Buch lesen, Spenden für unsere Genoss\*innen sammeln und mit euch ins Gespräch kommen. Wir wollen die Stimmen von Dima, Finbar und Cooper hörbar machen, die eine schwerwiegende Wahl getroffen und dafür einen hohen Preis gezahlt haben. Was haben sie uns zu sagen? Was bedeutet das für uns? Und welche Schlüsse ziehen wir daraus?

        <abstract>Bei "Off The Record" nehmen wir euch mit in den Maschinenraum von netzpolitik.org. Einmal im Monat geben Redakteur:innen und andere Team-Mitglieder Einblicke in ihre Arbeit. Bei dieser Live-Ausgabe zum Abschluss des Jahres wollen wir hinter die Kulissen einiger große Recherchen blicken: Es geht um Spionage-Apps und Datenhändler, eine mysteriöse Schallwaffe und die Tücken der Verwaltungsdigitalisierung.</abstract>
        <description>In "Off/On", dem Podcast von netzpolitik.org, wechseln sich zwei Formate ab: Bei "Off The Record" geht es ab in den Maschinenraum von netzpolitik.org: Wir erzählen, wie unsere Recherchen entstehen, und machen transparent, wie wir arbeiten. Bei "On The Record" interviewen wir Menschen, die unsere digitale Gesellschaft prägen.

Bei dieser Live-Ausgabe von "Off The Record" spricht Ingo Dachwitz mit Chris Köver, Markus Reuter und Esther Mehnhard über ihre Recherchen des Jahres. Wie sind sie bei der Recherche vorgegangen? Welche Hindernisse mussten sie überwinden? Wie verpackt man komplexe Sachverhalten am besten? Und was haben die Recherchen ausgelöst?

        <abstract>„They Talk Tech“ Live: Podcasts-Hosts Svea Eckert und Eva Wolfangel diskutieren mit Anne Roth, Referentin für Digitalpolitik der Linksfraktion, Netzaktivistin, scharfe Beobachterin und präzise Analytikerin digitaler Machtstrukturen, über Überwachung, digitale Freiheitsrechte, feministische Netzpolitik und die politischen Kämpfe hinter der Technologie.</abstract>
        <description>Anne Roth beschäftigt sich seit vielen Jahren mit staatlichen Sicherheitsarchitekturen, Geheimdienstkontrolle, digitaler Gewalt und Fragen politischer Teilhabe. Im Gespräch geht es um die Mechanismen digitaler Macht, um Freiheitsrechte im Zeitalter permanenter Datenerfassung und darum, wie politische Entscheidungen technologische Entwicklungen prägen und umgekehrt - und wo die netzpolitische Community auch in politisch schwierigen Zeiten ansetzen kann, um die Entwicklung positiv zu beeinflussen.

Eine offene, präzise und lebendige Diskussion, die sowohl technisch interessierte als auch politisch denkende Menschen abholt. Live und mit Raum für eure Fragen.

"They Talk Tech" ist ein c't-Podcast von Svea Eckert und Eva Wolfangel

        <abstract>Der inkompetente Podcast über Dresscodes und Mode. Warum verschiedene Kleiderordnungen immer mal wieder zu komischen Situationen und politischen Missverständnissen gesorgt haben. Warum ist der Business Dress eigentlich nur ein besserer Hausanzug ? Warum wird aus gemütlicher Kleidung eine Kleidung die bei Staatsempfängen getragen wird. Warum ist ein Dresscode immer missverständlich ? Bitte zum Vortrag  in smart Casual  Business white Tie, aber nicht zu formal erscheinen. Wer das versteht oder auch nicht wird sich wohlfühlen.</abstract>
        <description>Eine kleine Reise über die merkwürdige Welt der (Männer) Mode, die halt wenig sinnvoll ist. Mode ist halt nur eine Möglichkeit sich von anderen Abzugrenzen.

        <abstract>We all have heard about the darknet - but how to navigate to and through it? How to start with the TOR-Browser?  &#13;
&#13;
We all heard about vulnerabilities - but how do Hackers use these?</abstract>
        <description>***FLINTA*-only***
This one-hour workshop focuses on the secure and responsible use of offensive security tools. We'll take a practical look at Metasploit, Torify, and related tools to understand how to test attack surfaces while maintaining privacy and anonymity.

Together, we'll discuss setting up a small test environment, routing traffic through Tor and proxy chains, and discuss the limits of technical anonymization—including legal and ethical aspects.

Objective:
You'll learn how to use Metasploit securely in a lab setup, what Torify can do, and where caution is advised.

Level: Intermediate (basic knowledge of Linux and networking recommended)
Duration: Approx. 1 hour
What to bring: Laptop with Linux (VM is acceptable), Metasploit, and Tor tools

        <description>Workshop zu politischem Druck von rechts und sexistischen Machtpraktiken in der Kommunalpolitik. Grundlage sind Situationen aus ostdeutsch-ländlichen Kommunen, in denen FLINTA*s bewusst isoliert, geschwächt oder aus politischen Prozessen gedrängt werden. In einem eigens für den Workshop entwickelten Serious Game werden mögliche Reaktionen durchgespielt und unter realistischen Bedingungen bewertet. Die Teilnehmenden müssen entscheiden, welche Schritte tragfähig sind und welche die eigene Position verschlechtern. Ziel ist es die Handlungssicherheit im Umgang mit  ausgrenzenden und abwertenden Situationen zu stärken.

Der Workshop ist FLINTA-only. Der geschützte Rahmen soll ermöglichen, dass Erfahrungen ausgesprochen, Konflikte klar analysiert und Strategien ohne Beobachtungsdruck entwickelt werden können. „Safe Space“ meint hier die Abwesenheit jener Dynamiken, die in der Praxis Einschüchterung und Selbstzensur erzwingen.

        <description>Was ist eigentlich Git und wie kann Git mir helfen, den Überblick über Änderungen an meinem Code zu behalten? Dieser Workshop bietet eine Einführung in die Quellcode-Verwaltung mit Git für absolute Anfänger*innen.

Gemeinsam werden wir...
- überlegen, wofür wir Git überhaupt brauchen und womit Git uns helfen kann.
- Git installieren.
- ein "Repository" anlegen.
- lernen, was eigentlich alle diese Begriffe wie "Repository" und "Commit" meinen.
- Dateien in einem Projekt versionieren.
- uns den Änderungsverlauf von einem Projekt anschauen.
- verschiedene Versionen einer Datei zusammenführen.

**Anmeldung zum Workshop:** Wenn du am Workshop teilnehmen möchtest, registriere dich bitte am Haecksen-Helpdesk. Es gibt insgesamt 30 Plätze.

**Material:** Zum Mitmachen bitte einen (idealerweise aufgeladenen) Laptop mit Internetzugang mitbringen.

PS: Für die Teilnahme sind keine Programmierkenntnisse erforderlich. Git wird meist für die Verwaltung von Quellcode verwendet, kann aber auch zur Verwaltung anderer Textdateien verwendet werden.

PPS: Wir arbeiten mit Git auf der Kommandozeile. Ich versuche dies so zu gestalten, dass auch Kommandozeilen-Neulinge ohne Vorkenntnisse gut mitkommen.

        <description>Während der Pandemie entstand die Seite https://antistalking.haecksen.org/ in gemeinschaftlicher Arbeit verschiedener Haecksen. Seitdem sind neue Seiten hinzugekommen und neue Einfallstore wurden entdeckt. Einige Haecksen beraten Klient*innen per E-Mail und schulen Frauenberatungsstellen.
Auch Chaostreffs können unsere Arbeit durch Hardwarespenden unterstützen, denn häufig müssen Geräte zur Beweissicherung stillgelegt werden.
Es soll aufgezeigt werden, wie die Seite den Beratenden helfen kann und wie man sie anwendet.
Im Anschluss werde ich Beratung in der Haecksen-Assembly anbieten, auch für privatere Fragen.

        <title>Tech-Transcendentalism as Hypermodern Myth and Neofeudal Ideology [all creatures welcome]</title>

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>The tech-libertarian transhumanist narrative is nothing but a hypermodern salvation myth. It is used to propagate a feudalist model of society in which a select few reap all the benefits. We discuss this ideology and how to oppose it.</abstract>
        <description>**tl;dr:** A libertarian mindset among tech-affine people often goes together with political ideas that seem to promote freedom and progress, but really stand for a crypto-fascist neufeudalism, and the transhumanist idea that we can and need to take control of human evolution by technological means—in the narrow image of those who promote this view, and to the detriment of diverse people with other world views or ways of life.

The inclusion of Joscha Bach's talk at 39C3 and its subsequent cancellation, after his emails with Jeffrey Epstein were made public, has generated much needed discussion about this close connection between **the libertarian right in tech**, the **TESCREAL** bundle of throught schools (transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism, effective altruism, and longtermism), and covertly or overtly misogynist / queer- &amp; transphobic / misanthropic **patriarchal**, **authoritarian**, and **fascist ideologies**.

None of this is particularly new. Analysis of these connections stretches back decades. It reveals a shocking amount of supremacism, egotism, and immaturity, a profound lack of responsibility, the celebration of behavior that targets undesired minorities, and political incorrectness under the guise of "free speech," from the very beginnings of the tech industry to the present moment [1,2].

Last year, Bach presented at 38C3, where he reduced the human mind to software, fetishized the mismeasure of human intelligence by IQ, and called for the effective dehumanization of humanity (quote: "we anthropomorphize people way too much") [3].

Recently, another connection has been highlighted: that between **transhumanist narratives** and **religious salvation myths** [4,5,6] and **apocalyptic revelations** [7,8,9]. The basic idea is that our world is about to unravel and our capacities will soon be outclassed by superintelligent machines that—for all practical purposes—take on the role of god(s). For the *accelerationist*, this is a good thing because, with the proper alignment, it will enable us to upload our minds to the cloud, live forever, and thus conquer the galaxy. For the *doomer*, surprisingly, this is not a bad thing either, because humanity is but an intermediate stage—crossing Nietzsche's famous &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/384722-man-is-a-rope-stretched-between-the-animal-and-the"&gt;rope&lt;/a&gt;—between the primitive ape descending from the trees and the infallible machines that will inevitably replace us, marking the next step in some sort of strange imagined *&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being"&gt;Great Chain of Being&lt;/a&gt;*. Human extinction, therefore, is to be welcomed.

In these **hypermodern apocalypse myths**, God and the devil in the traditional religious narrative have simply been replaced by our future machine overlords. Just take Peter Thiel's invocation of the *antichrist* (nicely contextualized and summarized in [7,8,9]), some sinister force that prevents technological progress from saving humanity and leading us into our glorious future. Or Bach himself who—in an interview on the Jim Rutt Show—outlined an *Aquinean approach to alignment*: all it takes to get along with AGI is love, hope, and faith [10]. The *apotheotic drive* behind all this is not exactly subtle.

Such dramatic-sounding (and weirdly spiritual) visions of the future cover up a dark political agenda, sometimes called the **dark enlightenment** [11,12], which is being implemented in their shadow: a totalitarian form of **libertarian neufeudalism** designed to enrich a very small elite of billionaires at the cost of the rest of humanity and the ecological health of our planet. The idea is for the chosen few to survive the coming megacrisis without having to worry about us—the other 98%. This side of transhumanism looks more like a crazed end-time cult than the pan-rationalist utopia it pretends to be in public.

This entire view is based on an astonishing amount of hubris. It reveals a lack of empathy and human connection. It is also completely detached from reality, assuming technological capabilities and an individual capacity to survive that are very unlikely to ever come to pass. It is a myth in both senses of the term: a visionary narrative for this epoch of late-stage capitalism, but also a foolish fairy tale with no relevance to what is actually going on.

What explains the **appeal** of such a **delusional** and **anti-human ideology**?

One reason is widespread *ignorance* when it comes to the true nature of this heterogeneous movement. It does not even try to hide from view but—backed by a spittle-licking tech-media information clique and the idea that "boys will be boys" but that's not too harmful and, anyway, this phase will pass—it manages to cover its tracks quite effectively and to get away with pretty much anything at the moment—even buying itself a Vice President of the U.S. of A. [13].

The second reason is the following: in this time of looming crisis, a lot of us are looking for *positive visions of the future*, for narratives that suggest workable paths our of our current predicament. This is why many otherwise intelligent and tech-savvy folks are surprisingly susceptible to the dangerous and anti-social delusion of the hypermodern myth of technological salvation. We desperately *want* it to be true.

**Workshop Format:** (60 min)

This workshop consists of a short (10 min) introductory talk by Yogi Jaeger, which summarizes the main theses of his 2023 essay on tech-transcendentalism [6], followed by comments from ElleJay.

The main part of the workshop consists of a **moderated deliberative discussion with the audience**. We want to exchange ideas and perspectives, as well as experiences, especially from the standpoints of different minority groups impacted by this ideology.

**The aim of our deliberations is to raise awareness of the presence and influence of transhumanist crypto-fascism in the community, and to come up with specific strategies how to oppose this problematic ideology while providing alternative visions for a thriving and diverse humanity in the 21st century.**

The time is perfect to raise this important topic at 39C3—not just because of the debate about Bach, but also because it seems to be garnering more and more attention, at least in English-speaking world.

        <abstract>FLINTA kennen meist einige FLINTA, die sexualisierte Gewalt von cis Männern erfahren haben, Cis Männer kennen oft keinen cis Mann, der sexualisierte Gewalt ausgeübt hat. Wie kommt das?&#13;
Ein Workshop für Männer.</abstract>
        <description>Wie können Männer über das Thema ins Gespräch kommen? Wie können Männer andere Männer auf sexistisches und grenzüberschreitendes Verhalten ansprechen?
Der Workshop möchte einen Austausch anregen, welche Barrieren es gibt, andere Männer auf problematisches Verhalten anzusprechen, aber auch darüber, wie diese überwunden werden können. Es geht nicht darum, FLINTA ausschließlich als Betroffene anzusehen und cis Männer ausschließlich als Ausübende. Dennoch ist es wichtig, dass (cis) Männer Verantwortung übernehmen und solche Gespräche führen. Als solidarische Praxis, aber auch als Prävention. 
Im Workshop können Ideen, Erfahrungen und Strategien miteinander geteilt oder zusammen entwickelt werden. Also kommt vorbei, wenn ihr diese Gespräche bereits führt, wenn ihr euch bisher noch nicht getraut habt oder auch, wenn ihr ein so cooles Umfeld habt, dass sie gar nicht nötig sind.

Der Workshop richtet sich an Männer. Wir werden dies auch zu Beginn formulieren, aber wir wollen natürlich keine Nachweise. 
Julian [er/ they] und buecherwurm [sie/ ihr, agender] werden den Workshop begleiten, buecherwurm wird sich auf den methodischen Rahmen fokussieren und vermutlich irgendwann rausziehen.

        <abstract>Rust programming language: An absolute beginner workshop with intro presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Absolute beginner means “beginner in Rust” just as well as “beginner in programming”. Anyone interested can benefit from the introductory presentation, the exercises and our guidance, regardless of experience.</abstract>
        <description>**A heartfelt welcome!**

We will hold a Rust workshop for beginners.

We will start with an introduction in the form of a lecture of about 45 minutes.

This will be followed by a period of about 120 minutes (including a break), during which you are going to work through exercises independently and at your own pace.

We will help with any questions. We — and you — will be supported by the automated Rustlings course.

Other experienced Rust developers will be on hand to help all participants directly with questions during the workshop.

Don't hold back: You are very welcome to ask questions during the workshop!

**You will need:**

- A laptop, prepared as described below, so we can get started right away.

**Preparation**

- Follow the instructions at **&lt;https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/&gt;** for the installation of Rust itself, as well as the interactive Rustlings course.
- Also note the instructions for the editor and terminal. The integration with [**rust-analyzer**](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) will make your Rust experience much more enjoyable!

**Verify that your setup works ahead of time!**

If you would like to receive help setting this up or verifying that your setup works well (especially if you use Windows), please come by our friendly Rust assembly or contact me directly.

**Power supply**

The workshop rooms at the venue are not well prepared for work with many laptops: unfortunately, there will not be any power sockets at the tables!

- Please bring your laptop fully charged.
- If you can, then bring a long cable and multi-sockets, so you can provide yourself and others with electricity.

**See you at the workshop — great to have you!**

        <abstract>Der Theatertechniker Elias baut zusammen mit seinen Freunden ein voll funktionsfähiges Steampunk-U-Boot. Während Nico Menschen aus den Wellen des Mittelmeers rettet, rät der 70-jährige Künstler Jim: „Tu es nicht. Repariere keine Autos, sondern mach lieber etwas im Leben, was du wirklich willst.“ Elias fragt sich: Muss man sich zwischen Selbstverwirklichung und selbstlosem Handeln entscheiden? Wovon hängt die Verantwortung gegenüber Einzelpersonen oder der Gesellschaft insgesamt ab?</abstract>
        <description>**Artist: Christoph Fleischer**

**Genre: Documentary, 92 min**

*DE with EN subtitles, 2024*

Theatre engineer Elias builds a fully functional steampunk submarine together with his friends. While Nico rescues people from the waves of the Mediterranean, the 70-year-old artist Jim advises: ”Don‘t do it. Don’t fix cars, but rather do something in life that you really want to”. Elias asks himself: Is there a decision to be made between self-realization and selfless-action? Upon what does responsibility towards individuals or larger society depend?
ABOUT WATER AND DREAMS is a philosophical journey that questions the meaningfulness of our actions and dares to dream publicly in our dreamless society.

Documentary film about the submarine project presented at 37C3 with a lecture.
Lecture - “How to build a submarine and survive” by Elias and Nico

Der Fluss und die Bewegung des Wassers steuern und lösen die Stimme aus und schaffen so ein einzigartiges Zusammenspiel zwischen den beiden Elementen. Es fängt die Stimme mitten in ihrem Trainingsprozess ein – wie sie sich verändert, stolpert und neu interpretiert.&#13;
Während sich das Wasser bewegt, formt und unterbricht es den Klang und verwandelt die Bewegung der Flüssigkeit in eine stimmliche Geste. Das Ergebnis ist weder rein menschlich noch rein künstlich, sondern etwas dazwischen – lebendig, instabil und sich ständig verändernd. „Water to Voice“ wird zu einem Dialog zwischen Natur und Technologie, einer fragilen Choreografie, in der die Stimme in Echtzeit lernt, ins Stocken gerät und sich weiterentwickelt.</abstract>
        <description>»Water to Voice« is an evolving piece born from the process of cloning Lisa’s voice. The flow and movement of water control and trigger the voice, creating a unique interplay between the two elements. It captures the voice in the midst of its training—shifting, stumbling, reinterpreting itself.
As the water moves, it shapes and disrupts the sound, transforming liquid motion into vocal gesture. What emerges is neither purely human nor purely artificial, but something in between—alive, unstable, and constantly transforming. »Water to Voice« becomes a dialogue between nature and technology, a fragile choreography in which the voice learns, falters, and evolves in real time.

Artist Bio:

The duo Lisa L. Zwinzscher &amp; Nina Bendix Igleses (Leipzig/Weimar) explores the boundaries of listening and voice in the digital realm. Emerging from Lisa L. Zwinzscher’s solo project Pony Pracht, which blends music with interactive, game-inspired visuals, her work expands to questions of identity and authenticity in the age of AI. As a singer, she has cloned her own voice, transforming it into a human-artificial live instrument. 
Fascinated by the tactile, sonic and metaphorical qualities of water, Nina Bendix Igleses approaches listening as a multisensory practice of relating to the world, investigating interconnection within and between self and environment.
Together, they engage with questions of identity, resonance, and transformation, creating sonic environments that explore what it means to be human.

        <abstract>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are reshaping the landscape of privacy, scalability, and trust in decentralized systems. In this workshop, we’ll explore how ZKPs let one party convince another that a statement is true, without revealing anything else about it. We aim to demystify the core ideas behind interactive protocols, walk through modern ZKP constructions, and examine how they’re deployed in cryptocurrencies and modern privacy-preserving designs. Participants will leave with a clear understanding of how the "prove without revealing" paradigm is shaping blockchain technology, verifiable computation, and the next generation of cryptographic standards.</abstract>

        <abstract>[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is an open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git. Unlike centralized code hosting platforms, such as GitHub or GitLab, there is no single entity controlling the network. Repositories are replicated across peers in a decentralized manner, and users retain sovereignty over their data and workflow.&#13;
&#13;
*Free your code!*</abstract>
        <description>Today, much of the open-source ecosystem depends on a few centralized code forges, even though modern version control systems are designed with fully distributed collaboration in mind.
This creates questionable dependencies with regards to governance and supply-chain security.
In this talk, we explore an alternative: [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), a decentralized, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git, that empowers developers to work together while staying sovereign.

Unlike traditional, centralized code forges that can impose censorship, Radicle ensures that each user retains control over their data, interactions, and collaboration, free from corporate influence.
This aligns with broader movements toward decentralization, open-source software, and the democratization of internet services.

 - We describe the Radicle gossip protocol, peer discovery, and secure data replication through cryptographic verification.
 - We highlight Radicle’s concept of *Collaborative Objects* (an implementation of conflict-free replicated data types, stored within the Git repository), which enables decentralized code reviews and issue management, and can be extended.
 - We demonstrate how Radicle integrates with familiar workflows while offering full control over code and issues, even when offline.
 - We share plans for future development of the network.

Attendees gain a comprehensive understanding of Radicle’s technical architecture, its practical benefits for decentralized code collaboration, and how it contributes to a more autonomous and resilient future for open-source development.

        <title>The Bitcoin Security Budget and Its Implications A Look at the Security, Scaling and Spam Resistance of Proof of Work Cryptocurrencies</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <language>en</language>
        <track/>
        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>The Bitcoin security budget has profound implications for the long term security of Bitcoin and similar proof of work cryptocurrencies. In this talk we discuss the various types of transaction fee markets for different cryptocurrencies and the possibility of transaction fees replacing falling block rewards to provide security in the future. The results from our analysis of the Monero fee market in particular do pose some very serious questions regarding the long term security and viability of cryptocurrencies that do not have a minimum fixed block reward or tail emission. We will discuss these questions and their implications for the possibility of a worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash system.</abstract>
        <description>Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, in October 2008, https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf,  during the 2008 financial crisis. The Bitcoin genesis block was mined in January 2009 launching the Bitcoin network. The design of Bitcoin has a maximum money supply of 21 million Bitcoin (BTC). The security budget consisting of the block reward and transaction fees per block is paid to the miner (creator) of each block as an incentive to secure the network. The blocks in Bitcoin are approximately every 10 minutes. The block reward is required by consensus to halve approximately every 4 years, starting at 50 BTC per block in 2009, and is currently at 3.125 BTC per block. This leads to a current annual growth rate of the total Bitcoin money supply that is below 1%. The next halving to 1.5625 BTC is estimated to occur in April of 2028. Transaction fees are currently less than 1% of the total Bitcoin security budget.

It is claimed in section 6 of the Bitcoin whitepaper that:

“Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free”;

however no evidence, theory or references are provided to support this claim.

The above model, with some variations, has been followed by most of the top proof of work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and ZCash (ZEC). There are however some notable exceptions, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR). Both Dogecoin and Monero have fixed block rewards. In Dogecoin this was the result of a bug in the code; however in Monero a fixed minimum block reward or tail emission was deliberately set at the constant rate 0.6 XMR per block. The blocks in Monero are approximately every 2 minutes. This leads to an annual growth rate of the total Monero money supply that is below 1%. For comparison the historical annual compounded rate of growth of the gold money supply is close to 1%.

The fee market in a cryptocurrency is also highly dependent on whether the blocksize is fixed, as in  Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin and ZCash or adaptive as in Bitcoin Cash and Monero. In the case of adaptive blocksizes the question becomes: Is there a penalty (cost) to increase the blocksize as in Monero or no cost to increase the blocksize as in Bitcoin Cash?

A balance needs to be found in the design of a cryptocurrency between allowing for blocksize growth in order to support the transaction demand for peer to peer electronic cash, and the necessity of spam mitigation.   The use of privacy preserving technologies can also have a profound impact on this balance, by increasing the transaction size, while at the same time preventing the use of censorship, as a means of spam mitigation. In Monero for example this increase will be by a factor of around 20 times, after the upcoming Full Chain Membership Proofs, plus plus (FCMP++) hard fork. This makes finding this balance in cryptocurrencies such as Monero with no option to opt out of privacy, by far the hardest. On the other hand a solution that works in Monero will also work in a cryptocurrency with a lesser degree of privacy.

In the presentation we will discuss the following questions:
How do the various types of fee markets: fixed blocksize, adaptive blocksize with penalty, and adaptive blocksize without penalty work?
Can transaction fees replace the falling block rewards or are fixed block rewards necessary?
Are there advantages or disadvantages to replacing block rewards with transaction fees?
Is it possible to have a fixed block reward and still be inflation free? 
Do we have a peer-to-peer electronic cash system or just another kind of asset for investment and speculation using centralized financial institutions?
Is a worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash system possible now or in the foreseeable future?

We will also discuss some of the broader implications

        <abstract>Augustin Bielefeld, principal engineer at Eilbek Research, has been growing mycelium and other micro-organisms since 2023, and will present his journey building a reproducible and affordable bioreactor, which is destined to be open-sourced.&#13;
&#13;
This talk is aimed at people with an interest in mycology/microbiology but the principles demonstrated are accessible to everyone.</abstract>
        <description>Mycology is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the biohacking/microbiology scene, people cultivate and grow mushrooms for their taste, nootropic properties, and even as construction materials.

Bioreactors, while rarely found on a hobbyist's desk - are the proper way to carry out cultivation and innoculation of micro-organism. This talk will explain their principles in simple terms, as well as showing off the speaker's journey building a reproducible and affordable reactor.

Bioreactors are not usually found in hobbyists mushroom growers yet they enable:
- Very fast culture times compared to usual jars
- Efficient and sterile innoculation and expansion
- Cultivation not just of mycelium, but of any microorganism such as algae, or even insulin producing bacteria

The demonstrator that will be presented enables not only cultivation of mycelium of all types, but also cultivation of complex micro-organisms such as insulin-producing bacteria, and other DIY-medicine goals.

        <description>The voting app is a simple blockchain voting app, based on ZK proof generated from a french ID card. The presentation will deep dive in the tech part, first but also present the social movement that wants to bring the referendum culture in France through a voting system that is independent from the State infrastructure, but still can prove that voters are french with the ID digital signature.
The voting app is Work in Progress and needs a lot of work. This is also an open call for hackers to help improve and make the app the easiest app for people.

        <abstract>In this talk, I will cover how XMPP manages metadata, what is technically required for which reason, what could be avoided and with which drawbacks, and do some comparisons with centralized (e.g. signal), other decentralized (e.g. matrix) and entirerly p2p systems trying to solve the same issue.</abstract>

        <abstract>Boot software like BIOS or UEFI are usually nonfree. They still run after the operating system is booted and often contain restrictions (like refusing to boot when the WiFi card is replaced) and are usually related to technologies of control like the Management engine or similar.&#13;
&#13;
On computers with a Management engine, replacing the nonfree BIOS with GNU Boot also removes the Management Engine operating system.&#13;
&#13;
The install party will take place in a room at the GNU Boot assembly location and the maintainers will be available to help you install GNU Boot on a supported computer (see https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuboot/status.html for a list).</abstract>

        <abstract>What might future p2p networks look like?</abstract>
        <description>In the early 2000s, a range of p2p network structures were explored. This led to systems in use today for both coordination (like DHTs) and communication (like Gossiping).

We have more tools today to model, prototype, and evaluate structures. The first step though is to imagine them.
What can we design to reach cases beyond DHTs? - What might network-level structures look like that might be safer, more scalable, more private, and/or more resilient than the ones we have today?

Tables will be provided with seeding inspiration and paper for recording ideas, to serve as inspiration for subsequent network system modeling.

        <abstract>Come drink some tea and learn about how a slower internet can help empower people and maybe fight capitalism a bit more. Maybe with help of Delay Tolerant Networks, Bundle Protocol and Archipel.</abstract>
        <description>Delay Tolerant networks are special kinds of network that allow messages to be transmitted with a (very) long delay. This is achieved by storing data along routing path, on each node. Archipel is an experimental implementation of Bundle Protocol focused on creating a more human network and reducing ecological footprint of network infrastructures.

This meetup is a conversation to present and talk about Delay Tolerant Networks and Archipel. We'll take some tea and talk about how a slower internet can help empower people and maybe fight capitalism a bit more.

        <abstract>It's the end of 2025 and digital authoritarianism becomes only ever more sophisticated. We want to use this opportunity to pause and reflect: how is the situation for citizens in different contexts around the world? What are people's actual needs? Which projects exist in this space? What is today's consumer hardware and software capable of to help making connections despite all attempts to the contrary?</abstract>
        <description>While this session is hosted by The Briar Project, we explicitly welcome all other collectives and individuals interested and working in this area of Internet shutdowns and digital censorship. Let's see where we can join forces to best serve users' needs.

        <description>Hi,

my name is Yuki and I am part of the DarkFi community. Out of this user/community perspective I will tell you something about the philosophy of DarkFi, the anonymous tech-stack, Lunarpunk, the Desert vs Forest, RegFi vs DarkFi and the DarkFi Vision.

The talk will not go to deep in the low level tech, because I am also just learning about them :)

I plan to keep the talk short and have a Q&amp;A personally after the talk, in a more 'relaxed' environment.

note: As you might expect, the talk will be held in english. But I can also speak german, if needed f.e

P.S: This is the first talk I will hold, I am very excited :)

        <abstract>As every Star Trek fan knows, humans are "ugly bags of mostly water" [S1E18] so RF communication in areas densely packed with humans - or their infrastructure made of metal and stone - is problematic.  &#13;
We'll explore ideas to overcome or mitigate this problem, ideas that are possible due to miniaturisation of RF devices and their constraints.</abstract>
        <description>We'll discuss
- what we trying to achieve / the problem at hand
- the physical, electrical and financial constraints of our solution compared to other approaches
- what changed, why can we do this in 2025 but not in 2015?

In the end we'll raise a tethered balloon with Meshcore and a Reticulum nodes indoors or - depending on the situation - outdoors and playfully check the height and range we can achieve.

This is a fun workshop that wants to encourage people to play with compact yet easily deployable communication infrastructure, there will be some basic maths and diagrams, but nothing intimidating.

        <description>We will be making own Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range devices Z-Wave Open Source SDK an Trident IoT SDK. It will also be possible to do Zigbee devices.

We will program a sensor and a switch using Z-Wave protocol and include it in a Z-Wave network. Or Zigbee.

We will also browse the Z-Wave Open Source project, and how existing Trident IoT and SiLabs code differ from them.

We will also install Linux version of Z-Way - Z-Wave/Zigbee/Matter Smart Home Controller. You will learn basics of Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range, how to include devices and set up security schemes.

We will also master using Z-Way smart home controller, investigate it's API and create own Linux or ESP32-based Z-Wave or Zigbee controller. We will also discuss Z-Wave/Zigbee-to-Matter bridging.

You will need a laptop (Linux, Mac or Windows) with SSH client, USB A, Google Chrome and internet access. Optionally you can use VS Code (install Trident IoT extension).

Bring your Z-Wave devices with you! If you have Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, take it too!

        <abstract>[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is an open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git. Unlike centralized code hosting platforms, such as GitHub or GitLab, there is no single entity controlling the network. Repositories are replicated across peers in a decentralized manner, and users retain sovereignty over their data and workflow.&#13;
&#13;
*Free your code!*</abstract>
        <description>Attend this workshop if you would like to try out Radicle. We'll set it up, and learn how to replicate a Git repository of your choice on the network. Further, learn how to use Radicle Patches and Radicle Issues for collaboration.

        <abstract>Introduction to Parks on the Air (POTA). POTA is an international radiosport award program that encourages licensed amateur radio operators to visit, enjoy and operate portable equipment in a variety of parks and public lands.</abstract>
        <description>POTA introduction "in a nutshell" followed by joint POTA activation on shortwave in the "Planten un Blomen" park right next to the CCH.

We meet daily at 01:00 p.m. at the Assembly for a short introduction and then go out into the park together. The participants learn how to set up a portable shortwave station and get a crash course in shortwave operation. Then it's time to get on the air! Other radio amateurs around the world are waiting to contact us. Can you manage the 10 radio connections necessary for a successful "activation" of the park?

NOTE: We meet AT THE CHAOSWELLE ASSEMBLY and start there with a short introduction to the POTA program. Then we go out into the park together. Dress warmly and weatherproof! We go outside even when it's raining or snowing!

If anyone wants to join us later: radio amateurs can reach us in the park on 145.500 MHz FM.

        <description>Wir beschäftigen uns damit wie Spiele aufgebaut werden und funktionieren und programmieren ein eigenes Spiel auf Grundlage von einer erweiterbaren und je nach Zeit und Interesse vollständig austauschbaren Jump'n'Run-Vorlage. Wir arbeiten dabei mit der Programmiersprache Python und der dazugehörigen Bibliothek PyGame.

Es ist kein Vorwissen notwendig um die Inhalte zu verstehen; der Workshop ist für alle geeignet die ein Interesse daran haben, zu verstehen wie Videospiele gemacht werden oder eigene Ideen für Spiele umsetzen wollen.

Wer sich ein Laptop für den Workshop ausleihen möchte, sollte sich spätestens eine Stunde vor dem Workshop an der Teckids-Assembly im Digitalcourage-Habitat melden.
Siehe auch [https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/project/detail/assembly/laptop-ausleihe-fur-junghackerinnen/](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/project/detail/assembly/laptop-ausleihe-fur-junghackerinnen/)
Wer ein eigenes Laptop benutzen möchte, benötigt ein Linux-System mit Thonny und Tiled.

Wer nach den ersten 1,5 Stunden noch weiter machen möchte, kann [bei Teil 2 an der Teckids-Assembly]([https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/spieleprogrammieren-mit-pygame-teil-2-tag-2](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/spieleprogrammieren-mit-pygame-teil-2-tag-2)) weitermachen.

        <description>Lust auf einen spielerischen Einstieg ins Programmieren? In dieser Hour of Code lernen Kinder (und interessierte Erwachsene) mit Minecraft die Grundlagen des Codings. Wir steuern Figuren, lösen knifflige Rätsel und entdecken, wie man mit einfachen Befehlen spannende Dinge erschaffen kann. Keine Vorkenntnisse nötig – einfach ausprobieren und Spaß haben!

Programmieren kann ganz leicht sein – besonders, wenn man es mit Minecraft verbindet! In dieser Session arbeiten wir mit der Minecraft-Hour of Code von Code.org. Mit einer einfachen, blockbasierten Programmierumgebung könnt ihr Charaktere steuern, Herausforderungen meistern und ganz nebenbei verstehen, wie Code funktioniert.

Dieser Workshop richtet sich vor allem an Kinder, aber auch Erwachsene sind willkommen. Alles, was ihr braucht, ist Neugier und Lust, etwas Neues auszuprobieren!

**Wichtig:**
Es muss keine Software vorinstalliert werden. Ein moderner Browser reicht völlig. Damit ihr mitmachen könnt, braucht ihr jedoch ein internetfähiges Tablet oder einen Laptop. Bitte bringt euer eigenes Gerät mit! Vor Ort können leider keine Geräte gestellt werden.

        <description>Das freie Open-World-Spiel Luanti(Minetest) bietet viele Möglichkeiten, kreativ zu werden und zusammen zu spielen. Das Spielprinzip ist ähnlich zu Minecraft, dennoch ist Luanti ein ganz anderes Spiel und keineswegs ein nachgemachter Klon von Minecraft. Genau genommen ist Luanti ein Framework, also ein Baukasten, mit dem sich alle ihr eigenes Sandbox- oder Voxel-Game nach eigenen Vorstellungen zusammenbauen können.

Wir lernen Luanti und seine Erweiterungsmöglichkeiten kennen und programmieren eine eigene Mod, die dem Spiel individuelle Items hinzufügt. Zudem ist es möglich, eigene Craftingrezepte zu erstellen, mit denen die neuen Blöcke, Items oder Werkzeuge hergestellt werden können. Je nach Interesse und Zeit werden weitere Bereiche, wie das Programmieren von Commands, eingebracht.Freund*innen spielen kann. Dabei gibt es kleinere Mods, die einzelne Elemente des Spiels verändern, aber auch ganze Games, die ein eigenes Spielprinzip mit sich bringen.

        <description>Wettbewerb für Junghackerinnen von 5 Jahren bis 1000

Spaß am Gerät: Mehrere Teams bauen gleichzeitig mit Nudeln um die Wette. Dabei geht es um kreativen Umgang mit Technik und die Erfahrung, dass man Dinge auch jenseits der eigentlichen Verwendungszwecke gut gebrauchen kann. Junghacker bzw. solche die es werden wollen, können alleine oder als Team kommen. Es kann jeder mitmachen, der weiß, was eine Nudel ist.

PS: Es werden keine Lebensmittel verschwendet.

PPS: Erwachsene dürfen auch mitmachen, wenn sie den Junghacker keinen Platz wegnehmen. Sie werden aber wahrscheinlich gegen den Nachwuchs verlieren :-D

        <description>Kinder (ca. 6-99 Jahre) sind herzlich eingeladen, an diesem Schnupperkurs teilzunehmen.

Die Deutsche Gebärdensprache ist eine visuelle, vollwertige natürliche Sprache die nicht mit lautsprachlichem Deutsch verwandt ist. Sie wird vor allem in der Kommunikation zwischen und mit gehörlosen Menschen verwendet. In Deutschland gibt es eine lange Geschichte der Unterdrückung der Gebärdensprache.

Kursleitung durch eine zertifizierte DGS-Dozentin.

        <abstract>Wir begeben uns auf eine Entdeckungsreise durch Linux - von der Vielfalt eines Betriebssystems. Was ist (F)OSS? Wie sieht so ein Linux aus? Was kann man damit machen? Und kann man damit auch spielen?</abstract>
        <description>Wir wollen Linux für Schule und Freizeit zeigen, die Vorteile von freier OpenSource Software erklären, die Vielfalt der verfügbaren Programme und Tools sowie mit dem Vorurteil aufräumen, dass man zum Spielen dann ja doch immer Windows benötigt.

Der Workshop soll an drei Tagen am Beispiel des Schulsticks durch die Vielfalt des Systems führen.

Part 2: Abenteuer Kommandozeile

Heute geht es um die Kommandozeile -- das mysteriöse, häufig schwarze Fenster mit heller Schrift. Warum benutzen wir Text-Kommandos und was kann man damit Tolles machen? Und wie man mit etwas Kommandozeilen-Magie Andere beeindrucken kann. Von den absoluten Basics bis zu komplexen Einzeilern -- natürlich wieder zum selbst erleben und mitmachen!

Zielgruppe

Dieser komplette Workshop ist für absolute Neulinge (Computer überhaupt und/oder Linux). Aber auch, wer schon Windows einsetzt und mal über den Tellerrand schauen will, vielleicht sogar schon einmal über einen Wechsel nachgedacht hat, sich aber (noch) nicht traut, ist herzlich willkommen!

Voraussetzungen

Interesse und Neugier.

        <description>Ich (Bunthoernchen) möchte hier einen sicheren Raum schaffen, in dem wir uns als Eltern von queeren Kindern austauschen können.

Wie können wir unsere Kinder unterstützen? Welche Fragen kommen auf? Wie geht man mit Queerfeindlichkeit um? Was kommt auf mein Kind zu? Wie trete ich gegenüber Schule und Co auf? ...

Willkommen sind alle Eltern und Bezugspersonen von trans Kindern und nicht-binären Kindern (und Jugendlichen). Ihr müsst kein Vorwissen haben, egal, wie neu das Thema für euch ist, ihr seid willkommen.

Wer moderiert: Ich bin das Bunthoernchen, nutze die Pronomen: dey/dem und und bin Mama von drei Kindern. Eins meiner Kinder ist ein trans Kind. Ich habe einen pädagogischen Hintergrund und stehe im regelmäßigen Austausch mit anderen queeren Menschen.

        <abstract>Developing, using, and re-using [Free Software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/index.en.html) is fun, but declaring licensing and copyright information is not. [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) changes that. With three simple steps, it makes declaring licensing and copyright information unambiguous and perfectly human- and machine-readable.&#13;
&#13;
This is an interactive workshop as an introduction to the REUSE project and demonstration of how to make a repository REUSE compliant.</abstract>
        <description>As software has gotten more complex over the last years, the importance of declaring licensing information has become even more crucial. The FSFE's REUSE initiative contributes to the goal of clearly displaying legal information in Free Software projects by embedding it into every file of the repository. Any project following the REUSE recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable for both humans and machines. We ensure that individuals, organizations, and companies that are reusing code are aware of and respect the license terms chosen by its original author, thus making life easier for everyone involved in the software supply chain .

REUSE integrates seamlessly into development processes and other best practices of indicating Free Software licenses. In addition, there are tools and documentation to help you get started.

        <abstract>What if local communities operated their own data centres? How might that look and function? To what extent would it be democratic and sustainable? Who would (not) benefit from it?&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, we would like to think through, examine and discuss alternative models for the ownership and management of collective data centres. We will take a structured look at fundamental concepts, governance issues and implications, as well as discuss parallel ideas in other areas (cooperative banks or housing, community-supported agriculture) in the hope of initiating a broad discussion about alternatives to the profit and exploitation logic of the current data centre industry. Similar approaches to data centers that already exist include Nubo (Belgium), Espora (Mexico) and Wobcom (Germany).</abstract>

        <abstract>You may have heard of XSLT or maybe worked with it in the Past. A more recent development is the effort to remove XSLT from the web platform altogether... and yes, it is in your browser, too!</abstract>
        <description>But did you know that this family of Languages - it not only includes XSLT but also XPath and XQuery - is still very important in the digital humanities and other niches near you? Would you be surprised to learn that there is an effort to specify the next version 4?

Last year, I joined the QT4 Community Group that is working on that.

Come by if you are interested in hearing where we are headed or just to indulge in the drama about OppenSource maintenance, W3C politics, and why XML is still around even though JSON and YAML are so much simpler!

        <abstract>In our struggles for a better world, we need the right tools to organize collectively. Common solutions seldom align with our ideals of self-organization and freedom from hierarchy. But what tools work in contexts with activists who have little technical experience? And what is our role as hackers in these groups? We see the same challenges in other organizations building up counterpower through structure based organizing as well. So let's connect!</abstract>
        <description>We are tenants organizing ourselves in the Berlin Tenants Union to fight for better housing conditions. In our organization, we have some active members that need to plan, coordinate and document actions. At the same time, we are constantly growing with new members who have little experience in collective struggles. Onboarding them shouldn’t bring a steep learning curve, but rather empower people to participate right-away. So we need tools that require only a low level of technical expertise to get started.

Yet we’re facing a gap between our values (data sovereignty, open source, collective ownership) and our reality (onboarding friction, technical barriers, competing with Big Tech UX). But we are the advanced users in the technical sphere. So where do less technical users face difficulties so that they choose tools that don't align with our values? And are we mere facilitators or also educators in these spaces? That’s why we would like to exchange with like-minded people.

So let's connect and talk about the toolbox we want!



Some questions we would like to discuss:
- How can information and shared knowledge made accessible for new members?
- How can events be communicated and how can we mobilize for specific actions?
- Where should we store contact information from the people we organize?
- How can we keep track of active members?
- And what is our position as hackers in all of that?

        <abstract>Let's start to make our hackspaces and community networks multicast interconnected!</abstract>
        <description>Multicast allows to send information, for example audio or video streams, sensor data or service discovery messages, to many interested recipients with minimal overhead, without the need of a central, beefy server. A perfect fit with a decentral network like [dn42](https://dn42.dev/) or [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/)?

The fundamental standards for multicast aren't new but usable, "bugfree" implementations have been rare in the past. And multicast is typically not available on common consumer internet connections.

The former has changed though, great progress was made in OpenSource software, including Freifunk firmwares and mesh routing protocols, in recent years. Allowing us to experiment with this and potentially making it available to and from a wider, public, distributed audience and providers.

To really unfold the potential of multicast and to tackle the chicken &amp; egg problem it will be crucial to establish a multicast topology with a wide reach. So let's start with making our hackspaces and community networks multicast interconnected!

---

This session will kick off with a small presentation on IPv6 multicast routing. Followed by a practical, hands-on workshop to set up IPv6 multicast peerings based on PIM-SD ([RFC7761](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7761)) over dn42. While the presented tooling will focus on [bird](https://bird.network.cz/) with a dedicated [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) multicast channel + [pim6sd](https://github.com/troglobit/pim6sd) experimentation and discussion on other tools (maybe [FRR](https://frrouting.org/)?) and approaches will be highly encouraged.

Prerequisites: For the workshop part you should have a dn42 node or other BGP enabled router set up and connected beforehand and should have some experience with IPv6 unicast routing. Also feel free to stop by in the [#dn42-multicast](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/dn42-multicast) IRC channel on [HackInt](https://hackint.org/) in advance. Having some more "beta testers" and potential people to onboard others during the session would be appreciated :-).

If you are a commercial ISP or research institute with potential multicast peering opportunities for our community networks then we would also be very interested to hear from you.

        <abstract>**39C3 LED badge -- SMD for Beginners**  &#13;
&#13;
The 39C3 LED badge contains 42 LEDs that blink under control of of a pre-programmed 4 cent microcontroller. When the badge is alone, the LEDs will blink randomly. When it is among friends (when there are other badges nearby), it will display a chaser pattern. &#13;
&#13;
In this workshop you will learn how to solder Surface Mounted Devices using a normal soldering iron.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for beginners. Under 16s only with responsible adult supervision.</abstract>
        <description>### 39C3 LED badge -- SMD for Beginners

![39C3 LED badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/b/7dccaedbb7ec/39C3badge.png)

Surface Mounted Devices (SMDs) are small compared to Through Hole (TH) electronic components, and have the reputation of being difficult to work with as a hobyist: Difficult to see and handle, when you sneeze, you loose them and you can not easily use them on 2.54mm raster prototyping boards.

SMD components are designed to be used in a reflow soldering process where tiny dots of solder paste are applied to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), after which the SMD components are "Picked and Placed" on the PCB, after which the whole PCB is heated to the melting point of the solder ("reflowing"), actually completing the  electrical connections.

This workshop is aimed at showing you that the reputation of being difficult to work with is a bit undeserved, and that you can also work with SMDs using just a  regular soldering iron: With some simple tricks and a suitable selection of components (not the smallest possible), the vast majority of people can successfully complete this project.

Being able to solder SMD projects using just a simple soldering iron will also help you develop some skills that are useful if you  need to do "rework" on reflow soldering projects. Reflow soldering is also not difficult to do as a hobbyist, but requires a few more tools like a stencil to apply solder paste and either an oven or a hot plate to do the reflowing. It is, however, much quicker than soldering the parts one by one, and can yield more professional looking, cleaner, solder joints.

The project is an electronic name-badge - You should write your name (or nick) on it and wear it. It contains 42 LEDs, a microcontroller, some support components and an InfraRed transmitter and receiver that allow it to communicate with other badges. When the badge detects the presence of other badges ("friends") nearby, it will change its behaviour. It will not only interact with other 39C3 LED badges, but also with TBD badges - come visit the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp

### Costs
This workshop is donation based. Materials costs are 2 euro per badge. Donations will go towards 1) covering costs of the badges, 2) covering costs of running the hardware hacking area in general, 3) covering costs of organizing TBD (see the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp)

### Registration
The number of participants per session is limited. First come, first served. Either get a participation voucher beforehand or show up early (there may be places left).
There will be *numbered* paper vouchers available for each session some time in advance of each session. If you get a voucher and do not show up *before* the designated starting time, someone else may take your spot. Please don't take multiple vouchers and don't take  vouchers if you don't actually plan to participate.

### Getting a kit
Kits are part of the workshop and not for sale separately. You can, however easily source your own PCBs and parts and make kits yourself because the design is  MIT licensed open source.

**Taught by** fablab|nk.

**Workshop Itinerary**:
In this 3-hour workshop you will build your own Trigg: an open-hardware portable handheld games console which runs tile-based games that can be coded and uploaded directly from the browser. Check out the PDF build guide here: https://github.com/fablabnk/TriggWorkshop/blob/main/TriggBuildGuide.pdf

Trigg is our version of the Hack Club Sprig, which we adapted into a through-hole soldering kit in the FabLab of our coding school 42 Berlin, to teach soldering and basic electronics to coding students. Kits include a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and all components (batteries and USB cable not included).

Our workshop and build guide will take you from the basics of soldering through to assembling, soldering, flashing and testing your Trigg, increasing your confidence as you go. After building, come by to our assembly to code and flash your first game. Parent-child building teams are also very welcome.

        <abstract>Learn Arduino using TV-B-Gone as an example project. You've probably heard lots about Arduino. But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you. As an example project, we'll be creating a TV-B-Gone remote control out of an Arduino you can take home with you.</abstract>
        <description>**[Arduino](http://arduino.cc/)** is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use. It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes. Yet, it is powerful enough so that experienced expert geeks can use it for their projects as well.

This workshop is easy enough for _**total newbies**_ to **learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.**

Participants will make their own Arduino clone, and set it up on solderless breadboards to make their own [TV-B-Gone](http://www.tvbgone.com) remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics.

**Materials costs**:  
The workshop is free, but if you would like to partake in the hands-on aspects of the workshop, Mitch will have materials for **€40** (useful for making many different cool projects).

**Taught by** [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman).

_**Optional**:  Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it.  
Arduino software runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux._

**Workshop page:**  
[Arduino For Total Newbies workshop page](http://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects/tvbg_arduino/tvbg_arduino_workshop.php)

**Workshop Itinerary**:
* Intro to Arduino
* Very short lesson to learn everything you need to know about electronics!
* Then we will learn to solder. Don't let this scare you! I've taught tens of thousands of people to solder, most of whom have never made anything before in their lives. It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful.
* Then we will each make our own Arduino clone from a kit.
* Now that we each have our own Arduino board, we will set up the free and open-source *Arduino software* on our laptops (if you bring one) -- Windows, Linux, and MacOS are all fine!
* And then its time to make something and learn how easy it is to use Arduino! I'll (very easily!) show you how to read schematic diagrams, and you'll put together your own TV-B-Gone remote control using your Arduino clone board. We will use a solderless breadboard. These are really useful, and provide a fast, and very easy way to put circuits together without needing to solder.
* Target practice is available all over the world after the workshop.

[Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) is an online platform for connecting compatible boards to the Internet, building dashboards, and viewing your sensor data from anywhere. You’ll use it to get an ESP32 online and streaming live environmental readings.

## What You’ll Learn
During the workshop, you’ll solder, wire, and program sensors on an ESP32. You’ll connect your device to Arduino Cloud, set up a simple dashboard, and monitor temperature, humidity, and air pressure online. You’ll also display readings locally on a small screen.

## Materials
You’ll work with:
- Two ESP32 boards
- A BME280 sensor for temperature, humidity, and air pressure
- A small screen to display data locally

## Requirements
- A laptop
- Install the [Arduino Cloud Agent](https://cloud.arduino.cc/download-agent/)
- A USB-C data cable (limited number available to buy on the day)
- No previous experience required, beginner-friendly

## Materials Costs
It costs **€25** for a kit to take home.

## Instructions

## Taught by
[Arne](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/user/arne)

## Workshop Itinerary
We will assemble and solder the [TicTacLights Nano Colour](https://wiki.blinkenarea.org/index.php/TicTacLightsNanoColourEnglish) kit together. No prior knowledge of reflow soldering is required, but a steady hand (go easy on caffeine!) and good eyes are useful.

**The steps we'll go through are:**
1. Apply solder paste to the front board with a stencil
2. Place the 144 LEDs on the board one-by-one, using tweezers (this can easily take a couple of hours)
3. Solder the LEDs on a hot plate
4. Apply solder paste to the back of the board with another stencil
5. Place the microcontroller, capacitors, resistors and other components on the board one-by-one
6. Solder the components with a hot air
7. Repeat the same steps for the 2nd board (with far fewer components on it)
8. Test and debug the boards (this can take until after midnight if there are many problematic boards)

## Registration
To register for this workshop, please buy a kit at the [BlinkenArea](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/assembly/detail/blinkenarea) assembly *as early as possible*. Only a limited number of kits is available.

If you have any questions or would like to see an already built TicTacLights Nano Colour first, please visit us at the BlinkenArea.

        <abstract>Was haben WhatsApp, TikTok, YouTube und Instagram gemeinsam? Sie gehören zu riesigen Tech-Konzernen, die damit Geld verdienen, möglichst viel über dich zu wissen – was du magst, mit wem du chattest, wann du online bist und sogar, wo du dich aufhältst. Gerade jetzt, wo Plattformen sich immer stärker politischer Macht und wirtschaftlichen Interessen beugen – zum Beispiel in den USA – wird klar: Die Kontrolle über deine Daten liegt nicht bei dir, sondern bei ihnen.&#13;
&#13;
Zeit, das zu ändern!&#13;
&#13;
Für Jugendliche zwischen 12 und 18 Jahren</abstract>
        <description>In unserem Workshop [#unplugTrump](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/unplugTrump) schauen wir uns genau an, wie diese Plattformen funktionieren  Was ist ihr Geschäftsmodell? Warum sind sie „kostenlos“? Und was passiert mit den Daten, die du teilst?

Statt nur zu kritisieren, zeigen wir dir Alternativen: freie Messenger, unabhängige Suchmaschinen, dezentrale soziale Netzwerke und andere Tools, mit denen du selbst entscheidest, was du teilst – und mit wem. 🔎🌍

Du recherchierst selbst in kleinen Gruppen, testest Alternativen und findest heraus, was für dich funktioniert. Begleitet wirst du dabei von engagierten Mentor:innen, die dir Impulse geben, Fragen beantworten und dich beim Ausprobieren unterstützen. Am Ende präsentierst du deine Ergebnisse: Welche Tools kanntest du noch nicht? Welche könntest du dir vorstellen zu nutzen? Welche Plattformen verdienen dein Vertrauen?

Ob du bereits erste Erfahrungen mit diesen Themen hast oder dich zum ersten Mal damit beschäftigst: Du bist herzlich willkommen! Und gemeinsam machen wir den ersten Schritt in Richtung digitale Selbstbestimmung.

        <abstract>Im Workshop lernt ihr gemeinsam mit anderen Jugendlichen, aktiv zur OpenStreetMap beizutragen. Der Fokus liegt auf der Vermittlung von digitalen Kompetenzen, der Bedeutung freier Daten und der Förderung von Zusammenarbeit&#13;
&#13;
Für Jugendliche zwischen 12 und 18 Jahren</abstract>
        <description>Entdecke die Welt von OpenStreetMap und werde ein Teil der OpenData-Bewegung! 🗺️

Egal, ob du schon mal von OpenStreetMap gehört hast oder nicht, in unserem Workshop lernst du, wie du selbst aktiv an einer der größten freien Kartenprojekte der Welt mitwirken kannst. Hier erfährst du, warum OpenData so wichtig ist und wie jede:r Einzelne dazu beitragen kann, die Daten für alle Menschen besser zu machen.

Im Gegensatz zu den Karten großer Firmen wie Google Maps ist OpenStreetMap von der Community für die Community. Das bedeutet, dass jede:r Daten hinzufügen oder korrigieren kann. Und das Beste daran? Es macht riesigen Spaß, dabei mitzumachen! 😃

Also komm vorbei und lass uns gemeinsam die Welt ein Stückchen besser kartieren! 🌍

* DAY 4: 14:00 - 15:00</abstract>
        <description>Starting from the assumption that, as those privileged with knowledge and experience in technology, we are obliged to share it with people who don’t have such competencies. Strengthening non-tech communities is essential for our collective well-being. What is the minimum level of tech education that everyone engaged in class struggle should acquire? Do we have the tools to protect non-tech people in our environment beyond the hackerspaces communities? How to build horizontal safe-spaces, secure infrastructures to educate others and which tools and techniques are the most effective for education?

Let's have a discussion and create ready to use solutions.

DAY 2: 14:00 - 16:00&#13;
DAY 3: 14:00 - 16:00</abstract>
        <description>We print with building block tiles, also known as Lego Dots™, on paper.
There will be a short introduction to the printing technique and how to create the printing plates.
We print using the primary colors and can mix any other color as needed.
What makes Lego Dots™ exciting is that you are bound to a grid – in this case, 8×8 units. The tiles come in different shapes: circles, squares, quarter circles, and many more. Have a look at the gallery to see some examples.
We print using a press from the Open Press Project.
The print size is limited to 7×7 cm due to the press we are using.
It is a “jump-in” workshop with no registration required – when one person leaves, the next can join in.

DAY 3: 20:30 - 22:00</abstract>
        <description>Facial recognition systems are rapidly advancing - fusing infrared, facial geometry, gait, and metadata into oppressive infrastructures of racist policing and surveillance capitalism. At the same time, artists, activists and everyday citizens are developing creative ways to interfere, confuse, and disappear from automated identification.

Workshop 1: Break Your Face
Hands-on demonstration of Dazzle anti-surveillance makeup techniques. Live-testing our work to understand machine vision -and how to break it.

Workshop 2 + 3: Zine-making
Starting with a discussion of creative anti-surveillance tactics, we then combine the workshop participants' knowledge and experience to co-creating a zine.

Info: We will be using easily available live face filters on smart phones (instagram/snapchat/tiktok). Participants can use their own phones. The data is not uploaded or saved anywhere.

        <description>In this workshop, we will engage with digital publishing methods that operate independently of big tech platforms and products. We will build our own RSS files for personal websites, blogs and discuss pirate publishing forms, both online and offline.

We will present the idea of the PPDP-PRINTER, a DIY device currently under development that combines web2print scripts with a simple server and local online publishing/broadcasting capabilities. The printer converts files, prints via its dot-matrix printer, creates RSS feeds, and serves them online. Our aim with the PPDP-PRINTER is to create an all-in-one material manifestation of our resource collection Post-Platform Digital Publishing Toolkit

        <description>In the workshop, we discover motifs that genAIs tend to overlook: marine flora and fauna. On top of that, we will try to find out what these might look like in 10 years' time, under both utopian and dystopian conditions. We will work with image and video generators.

Performance DAY 4: art&amp;play [tba]</abstract>
        <description>This is an advanced soldering workshop for creating motorcontrollers that bring motors to tap rhythmically with each other. Each participant builds her own board to drive two motors that will then tap in polyrhythms. The electronic circuits in this workshop derive from minimal and low-cost bio-inspired robots. Oscillators are used to drive motors that produce sound, but they can also be connected to synthesizers. Each circuit board is designed to be wired up with the boards from the other participants in order to explore together the magic of emergent polyrhythm by wiring their individual circuits to form a huge network.
Big fun and deep dive into analog circuits and their emergent properties.

TAG 2: 14:00 - 16:00&#13;
TAG 3: 16:30 - 18:30</abstract>
        <description>Computer magazines from the early 2000s, interviews with magical thinking, and the most creative ways to reassure shareholders. The tech industry is full of technoid dreams, advertisements for the future, and error messages in continuous text. In this workshop, we hack these archives analogously: we cut, collage, and remix the old pages into new, poetic forms.

No prior knowledge is necessary. Scissors, glue and texts are provided (your own finds are welcome). The offered source material will be mostly in German.

Und egal, was uns immer erzählt wurde. Wir alle können zeichnen. Also: Stift raus, Power an – let’s draw!</abstract>
        <description>Drawing is like thinking and speaking at the same time. Just with our hands. And it helps us to understand and explain power dynamics. And despite all that we were told: we all can draw. So: pens out, full power — let’s draw!

        <description>Wie sieht eigentlich dein Inneres aus – und warum erkennt ein Ultraschallgerät Dinge, die wir nicht sehen können? In diesem Mini-Workshop zeigen euch Medics von CADUS &amp; CERT, wie Ultraschall funktioniert, wie Organe auf dem Screen sichtbar werden und warum das Ganze eher Physik als Zauberei ist. Ihr könnt live zuschauen, Fragen stellen – und mit Anleitung selbst ausprobieren.

        <abstract>Für die Katastrophe trainieren heißt am besten so realistisch wie möglich trainieren. Das praktizieren wir bei CADUS schon lange so gut wie nur irgend möglich. Aber wie simuliert mensch eigentlich Katastrophe? Und wie das Material, das man für die Trainings braucht? Und hat da grade wer „open source” gesagt?</abstract>
        <description>Our CADUS trainings are based on the motto “Train as you fight,” which means we try to make our operational simulations as realistic as possible. To achieve this, we have to simulate the “dangerous aspects” of disasters such as fire, explosions, toxic substances, highly infectious germs, radiation, dangerous injuries, etc.  Training equipment such as fire simulators, mannequins that can be used to train ultrasound examinations , radiation sources, and detectors are available on the market at exorbitant prices, making it impossible to scale high-quality, realistic training. In this open workshop format, we first want to show you how we've already approached this problem productively here and there... and then brainstorm together about where the journey could take us. From F/X to a bit of creative electronics, innovative event technology, to 3D printing and digital simulations. We are looking for elegant programming and realistic DIY constructions! So if you feel like brainstorming creative workarounds and maybe even implementing them with and for CADUS after the congress, come on by!

        <abstract>Entdecke das wahrscheinlich lustigste Instrument der Welt, die Nasenflöte! Nach einer kurzen Einführung übt jede*r in eigenem Tempo die ersten Töne. Klappt das Tröten, geht’s weiter mit einfachen Melodien – und schließlich spielen wir gemeinsam als Nasenflöten-Orchester beliebte Songs und Wunschmelodien.  Lustig, überraschend, musikalisch – und garantiert einmalig!</abstract>
        <description>Welcome to what is probably the world's only orchestra where the most important sound-producing instrument is... your nose! Each participant receives a fresh nose flute and easy-to-understand instructions on how to correctly position, breathe, and blow this wondrous instrument.  Then it's time to learn by sniffing! Everyone practices at their own pace how to conjure up individual notes cleanly from their nose—from a delicate peep to a confident TOOT.  Once everyone has got the hang of it (and the first tears of laughter have dried), we venture into simple sequences of notes that already sound suspiciously like music. And if that works well, it gets really epic: We transform ourselves into a nose flute a cappella orchestra, where everyone can suggest melodies – from children's songs to epic film themes. Together, we make the air vibrate!  In short: A workshop full of fun, tooting noises, unexpected talents – and real music from the nose.

        <abstract>There are many ways that we can get data from Wikidata. In this workshop we'll explore using Python to leverage popular APIs provided by Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia Deutschland as well as community developed packages to easily get data for projects and research. We'll specifically look at the pros and cons of using certain methods for certain types of data so that we can make educated decisions on the best tools to use to get the data we need.</abstract>

        <description>Innerhalb der letzten Monate konnten wir zwei schöne Jubiläen begehen, das gemeinsam von Wikimedia Österreich und Wikimedia Deutschland durchgeführte Format „GLAM digital“ konnte jüngst über 100 Gastvortragende begrüßen, die an über 50 Ausgaben teilgenommen haben. Fast jeden Monat bringt die Reihe ausgewählte Kultur- und Gedächtnisinstitutionen in den Austausch mit der Wikipedia-Community. Die beteiligten Institutionen reichten von großen Häusern wie dem Kunsthistorischen Museum in Wien oder dem Museum Barberini in Potsdam bis zu Entdeckungen wie dem Archiv deutscher Frauenbewegungen oder dem Osttiroler Bauernhofmuseum Wurzerhof. Auch Museumsverbände oder nationale UNESCO-Kommissionen zählten bereits zu den Gästen. Wir möchten euch das Format kurz vorstellen und euch zur Mitwirkung an künftigen Ausgaben von „GLAM digital“ einladen. Mehr zum Format könnt ihr auch in Blogbeiträgen oder in der Wikipedia nachlesen.

        <abstract>Wikidata enthält viele Daten zu geografischen Objekten. Die Möglichkeiten für die Darstellung von Geodaten innerhalb von MediaWiki sind jedoch beschränkt. Ich habe offene Geodaten aus dem Bereich Natur- und Denkmalschutz mit Wikidata verknüpft und damit eine Kartenanwendung gebaut. Diese Karte dient dazu, noch nicht fotografierte Schutzgebiete und Denkmäler zu finden und zu dokumentieren.</abstract>

        <abstract>Swahili, lexikographische Daten in Wikidata und Wikifunctions. Ein Team so stark wie Timon und Pumbaa.</abstract>
        <description>Angenommen du reist nach Nairobi zu einer Wikimedia-Konferenz, lernst gerade so Touri-Phrasen wie "Hujambo" und "Asante", und plötzlich beginnst du dich für die Datenstruktur der Sprache zu interessieren. Das ist mir dieses Jahr passiert. Swahili ist eine faszinierende Sprache, zu der ich ein bisschen was erzählen werde. Es geht u.a. um Nominalklassen und Verbtabellen und wie sie in einen Pandas DataFrame passen.

Leider gibt es ein Problem: Wikidata enthält kaum Swahili-Lexeme. Wörterbucheinträge sind rar und Definitionen noch rarer, sagt SPARQL, Das ist ein echtes Problem. Denn schließlich bedeuten mehr Swahili-Daten in Wikidata auch mehr Swahili im Semantic Web.

Mit Wikifunctions könnten wir Funktionen bauen, die automatisch Sätze wie einen Wikpedia-Artikela    nfang erzeugen ("Nairobi ist eine Stadt”), zum Beispiel in Swahili, auf Knopfdruck! Stell dir vor, ein Wikifunction-Generator erzeugt Swahili-Sätze, während Wikidata die nötigen Lexeme stellt. Das klingt wie ein Märchen? Wenn wir kollaborativ zusammenarbeiten, kann es Wirklichket werden.

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>Internet Governance beeinflusst, wie offen, sicher und zugänglich das Internet ist – von technischen Standards über Plattformregulierung bis hin zu Fragen von Macht und Teilhabe. In diesem interaktiven Ask Me Anything-Workshop laden wir Teilnehmende dazu ein, ihre Fragen, Zweifel und Kritik rund um Internet Governance einzubringen (unabhängig von Vorwissen).&#13;
&#13;
Der Workshop bietet einen niedrigschwelligen Einstieg in zentrale Akteure, Prozesse und Konfliktlinien der Internet Governance (z. B. Multistakeholder-Ansatz, Staaten vs. Tech-Konzerne, Global Digital Compact, WSIS, IETF, ICANN, W3C; und noch viel mehr Abkürzungen). Gleichzeitig ist Raum für vertiefende Diskussionen, persönliche Erfahrungen und aktuelle politische Aushandlungen. Ziel ist es, Internet Governance entmystifizieren, Machtstrukturen sichtbar zu machen und gemeinsam zu diskutieren, wie eine gerechtere und inklusivere digitale Zukunft aussehen kann.</abstract>

        <abstract>Join us for a workshop featuring three cool projects about open parliamentary data! [HowTheyVote.eu](https://howtheyvote.eu/) makes it easy to see how European Parliament members vote. [Open Parliament TV](https://de.openparliament.tv/) lets you search and interact with over 79,000 speeches from the German Bundestag. [Open Data Ranking](https://opendataranking.de/) shows how parliamentary data is (un)available in Germany. We'll talk about the fun of linked open data (oh hai [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Identifiers)), currently challenging conditions and how to make more people aware of it inside and outside of parliaments. We welcome everyone interested in open parliamentary data or working in/around parliaments!</abstract>

        <description>Energy must leave into space so we can communicate, for that we need antennas.
This small workshop will provide a rough introduction to what characteristics an antenna has and how you can build antennas for your devices. And in the end we'll build some antennas together, so that you are well equipped for congress.
We'll bring a small selection of tools as well as supplies, but we'll be happy if you bring some along yourself, too.
If you are a Junghacker:in this session is especially well suited for you, but if you want to join us for the same workshop in the afternoon you're as welcome.

        <abstract>Digital Humanities: Forschung in den Geisteswissenschaften in digitaler Form, kurz: DH. Wir treffen uns zu einem lockeren Kennenlernen und Gedankenaustausch. Was ist Euer Interesse an den DH, wo verortet Ihr Euch in der Chaosfamilie? Welche Themen des 39C3 könnten für die DH relevant sein - und umgekehrt?</abstract>
        <description>Digital Humanities: Forschung zu Literatur, Geschichte, Sprache, Kunst, Musik in digitaler Form - von Rechercheprozessen über Analysemethoden bis hin zu Publikationsformen. Als Brückendisziplin zwischen IT und geisteswissenschaftlichen Fächern operieren die "DH" aber nicht nur anwendungsbezogen, sondern auch transformativ: Sie evaluieren kritisch im Diskurs, welche Aspekte der fortlaufenden Digitalisierung für die wissenschaftliche Praxis förderlich genutzt werden können.

Damit sorgen sie aber auch stets für Aufregung, wenn es darum geht, etablierte wissenschaftliche Prozesse zu stören: Etwa, wenn es um Open Source, Open Science, Open Data geht sowie um FAIR- und CARE-Prinzipien oder um nichtproprietäre Standards. Wir begleiten als Digital Humanists somit nicht nur die Digitalisierung von Kulturdokumenten und Wissenschaft(sbürokratie), sondern auch von Arbeitsprozessen mit dem Ziel, in diesem Zuge auch eine freiere, fairere, nachhaltigere, zugänglichere, offenere und digitalsouveränere Wissenschaftspraxis zu etablieren.

Wir schließen an die Meetups der letzten beiden Jahre an und treffen uns wieder zu einem lockeren Kennenlernen und Gedankenaustausch (siehe unser Pad dazu: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/DHMeetup). Willkommen sind alle, die an den DH interessiert sind - und vermutlich sind viele bereits in der Chaos-Familie, ohne dass wir voneinander wissen. Wo in der Chaos-Familie verortet Ihr Euch? Welche Themen des 39C3 könnten für die DH relevant sein und umgekehrt? Kommt zahlreich! Nach Bedarf können wir weitere Meetups oder SoS zu spezifischen Themen organisieren.

        <description>OpenStreetMap is not a project but rather a movement with small core and many different applications and libraries to us the data. However, there is no central documentation and finding the right tool for your job is challenging. The first search result might work. Will it point to the right tool on long term? Will you run into performance issues or can it handle the complete dataset? How much memory can do you need for X?

In this Ask Us Anything session, you can ask all the questions about OpenStreetMap data usage as a software developer. As experienced developers for OpenStreetMap based services (and mappers), we have used lots of different libraries and tools to access and modify the data, to calculate routes or render maps.

        <description>Normally, you'd use a pegboard and an iron for fuse beads.

But you can also do it without... all you need is a needle and thread, and you can make bracelets or coasters.

Want to know how? Come by, let me show you, and get started yourself.

        <description>At Chaos Communication Camp 2023, padeluun called for the establishment of small, exciting companies. Digitalcourage operates a Fediverse instance that is financed by membership fees. In addition, there are commercial hosting services such as masto.host and Ossrox. What else is there, and what else is conceivable in the future? We discuss Fediverse business ideas, start-up assistance for company foundations (business plans, KfW start-up loans) and everything that can make the Fediverse an economic basis for founders. A workshop for gathering ideas, exchanging experiences and developing joint approaches. Recording of the presentation by padeluun 2023: https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57118-fediverse

        <description>When people say Mastodon, they often mean Fediverse—on the one hand because Mastodon represents a mainstream within the Fediverse, but on the other hand because even microblogging usage patterns can vary greatly and even within Mastodon there is no uniform usage pattern, which can make Mastodon seem confusing as a term. Automated posting of RSS feeds, personal exchanges with a closed community, global networking with peers from all over the world, or individual card index boxes—we categorize different ways of using the platform and draw inspiration from unusual approaches to uncover the relevance and potential of Fediverse.

        <abstract>Up-Cycling wörtlich genommen: Aus alten Fahrradketten entstehen verschiedene Fidgettoys zum Mitnehmen. Verschiedene Varianten können ausprobiert und Favoriten gleich selber nachgebaut werden. – Mit Anmeldung im Vorfeld. –</abstract>
        <description>Passend zum „Cycle“ im Kongresstitel zeige ich in diesem kleinen Workshop, wie aus alten Fahrradketten Fidgettoys gebastelt werden können. Im Vorfeld zeige ich einige verschiedene Varianten, die auch ausprobiert werden können, und dann geht es auch schon los. Geplant ist, dass jede Teilnehmer*in mit ein bis zwei Fidgettoys aus dem kurzen Workshop geht. Zusätzlich zu den Fahrradketten kommen Schlüsselringe und Schrumpfschlauch zum Einsatz, aber nicht bei allen Varianten.

Da es sich wirklich um alte Fahrradketten handelt, die ich zwar etwas vorreinige, macht es dennoch die Hände schmierig und dreckig. Es wird aber Babyfeuchttücher geben und einen Pott Handwaschcreme, der für solche Zwecke gut funktioniert, damit nachher alle wieder saubere Hände haben.

Dieser Workshop ist für alle ab 16. Ich werde im Vorfeld Listen zum Eintragen aufhängen. Geplant sind zwei kürzere Workshop-Slots zu je 30 Minuten in Gruppen von sechs bis acht Personen.

        <description>We usually encounter age verification checks online on pornography sites, gambling sites, or when we buy tobacco or alcohol online. There is much debate about whether this tool should also be used on other platforms. We usually encounter age verification checks online on pornography sites, gambling sites, or when we buy tobacco or alcohol online. There is much debate about whether this tool should also be used on other platforms. Following the social media ban in Australia and the Online Safety Act in the UK, the EU is also discussing a social media ban. I will give a short introduction to the political developments of the last year and then look forward to an open discussion. 
What does the expansion of age verification on the internet mean for you? 
In which Areas can age verification make sense? Or can it? 
How can age verification be designed technically? What are the pros and cons?
What risks and opportunities are not discussed enough in current debate?

(This discussion is a loose follow-up to the 38C3 Talk "Natürlich bin ich 18! Altersprüfungen im Netz" - You don't need to have seen the talk to participate here!)

        <abstract>Im Jahr 2026 findet in Berlin die nächste Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus statt.&#13;
&#13;
Wie stehen die dort antretenden Parteien zu Digital-Themen? Und wie lässt sich die Übereinstimmung mit eigenen Überzeugungen "berechnen"? Wie geht eins mit faschistischen Parteien um und welche anderen Details gilt es zu beachten?&#13;
&#13;
Der kleindatenverein.org hat bereits mehrere Digital-O-maten gebaut und wird auch zur Berliner Wahl 2026 einen anbieten. Nach einer Vorstellung möglicher Arten von Wahl-O-Maten, wollen wir uns für ein Modell entscheiden, die nächsten Schritte festlegen und idealerweise den ersten Code einschecken.&#13;
&#13;
Wer mitmachen oder auch einfach nur mal reinschnuppern will, ist herzlich willkommen. Keine Vorkenntnisse nötig.&#13;
&#13;
Leute aus anderen Bundesländern, in denen 2026 gewählt wird und die Interesse am Bau eines Digital-O-Maten haben, sind besonders willkommen.</abstract>

        <abstract>Du wolltest schon immer mal wissen, wie eine Glasfaser aufgebaut ist und miteinander verbunden wird? Dann bist du hier richtig. Dieser Slot ist exklusiv für JHT-Teilnehmende (Junghacker:innen-Tag).</abstract>
        <description>Zunächst erhältst du eine kurze generelle Erklärung, wie ein Splice funktioniert, auf was es dabei ankommt und was noch rings rum passiert. Anschließend kannst du das Glasfaserspleißen selbst ausprobieren. Du solltest grundsätzliches Interesse für die Thematik, ein wenig Geduld und ein ruhiges Händchen mitbringen.

Spleißen bezeichnet den Vorgang, durch den Faser-Enden einer Glasfaserkabel miteinander verbunden werden. Bei Singlemode-Glasfasern beträgt der Kerndurchmesser der eigentlichen Glasfaser 9µm und ist damit kleiner als ein menschliches Haar.

WICHTIG!!!
- Dieser Slot ist exklusiv für den Junghacker:innen-Tag. Weitere Slots auch bei der Selfnet-Assembly (gleiches Cluster)
- Es gibt nur wenige Plätze. First come, first serve.

        <description>There are some version 1.5 and version 2.0 TBD friends badges left to solder. Badges contain blinking lights and 2-way communication, so the badge can tell you if there are friends around that also wear their TBD friends badge.

Soldering is done using solder paste and a hotplate. Takes about 1 hour for beginners (which mainly depends on my divergence when I talk you through it). Record time is 12 minutes.

Badges are donation-ware - Pay whatever you like to TBD. Materials costs are currently about 1.5 euro

If you miss the scheduled event, contact The0 (DECT or OFTC) - it may be possible to schedule an extra session

        <description>Make light sound or mechanical circuits. The electronic building blocks from OEM Dbolo are not only especially child-friendly due to their simple push-button connections but also a lot of fun for all ages. They are distributed by various brands, including "Kosmos Easy" and "Elenco Snap Circuits." No prior knowledge of electricity is required, but beware - learning something might happen! This is an open parent-child activity. Learn, build, and play together, and take care for arguments and that the parts don’t fall on the floor. Teenagers and adults are also welcome without child accompaniment. ;-)

        <abstract>Die DSGVO ist in aller Munde, aber was bedeutet sie eigentlich für Dich? Wir wollen uns die Rechte, die Dir durch die DSGVO zugesichert werden, einmal genauer anschauen und – vor allem — ausprobieren. In unserem Workshop lernst Du, mit Datenanfragen.de Anfragen zu stellen, um an Deine Daten zu kommen, sie löschen zu lassen, zu berichtigen oder Widerspruch gegen Direktwerbung einzulegen.</abstract>
        <description>Online-Shops, Streamingdienste, Banken, Handy-Apps, öffentliche Stellen, Versicherungen, soziale Netzwerke … Die Liste an Organisationen, die Deine Daten haben wollen, ist sehr lang. Wahrscheinlich gibt es sogar etliche Unternehmen wie Adresshändler und Auskunfteien, die zwar Deine Daten haben, von denen Du aber noch nie etwas gehört hast.

Zum Glück musst Du Dich nicht damit abfinden, „dass das halt so ist“. Denn Du hast ein Recht auf Datenschutz! Wenn Unternehmen, Behörden und andere Organisationen Deine personenbezogenen Daten nutzen wollen, müssen sie sich dabei an die Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) halten. Damit Du die Kontrolle über Deine Daten behalten kannst, gewährt Dir die DSGVO eine Reihe von Rechten, die Du den Organisationen gegenüber kostenlos geltendmachen darfst: Das Recht auf Auskunft darüber, welche Daten zu Dir verarbeitet werden, einschließlich einer Kopie dieser Daten, das Recht auf Berichtigung unrichtiger Daten zu Dir, das Recht auf Löschung Deiner Daten unter bestimmten Umständen, und das Recht auf Werbewiderspruch.

Wir sind ein gemeinnütziger Verein, der daran arbeitet, diese Rechte allen Menschen zugänglich zu machen. Dafür betreiben wir vor allem die Webseite Datenanfragen.de, die Dich durch den gesamten Anfragenprozess leitet und am Ende den Anfragentext generiert, den Du nur noch an die entsprechenden Organisationen abschicken musst.

In diesem Workshop wollen wir Dich einladen, von Deinen Rechten Gebrauch zu machen und mehr darüber zu erfahren, wer welche Daten zu Dir hat. Dazu erklären wir Dir näher, was es mit Deinen Datenschutzrechten und unseren Werkzeugen auf sich hat und stellen dann gemeinsam Anfragen. Keine Sorge: Du brauchst dafür keine technischen oder rechtlichen Vorkenntnisse.

        <abstract>Bei uns kannst Du sehr einfach Deiner ePA widersprechen. Hierfür haben wir für Dich ein Formular vorbereitet, dass Du ausfüllst, wir schicken das dann an Deine Krankenkasse. &#13;
Das geht auch außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten", komm einfach jederzeit vorbei, auch wenn wir nicht da sind liegt eine Anleitung aus wie das funktioniert.&#13;
Darüber hinaus bieten wir noch andere Widersprüche und Auskünfte an.</abstract>
        <description>Als gesetzlich Versicherter hast Du Anfang 2025 eine ePA erhalten, in der fortan alle Deine Behandlungsdaten (Diagnosen, Medikamente, Zahnbehandlungen, ...) protokolliert werden. Wir raten zum Widerspruch und helfen gerne dabei und stehen für Fragen zur Verfügung.

Darüber hinaus bieten wir Widerspruchsformulare gegen das Durchsuchen Deiner Abrechnungsdaten durch die Krankenkassen an. Damit will die Krankenkasse auf Basis Deiner persönlichen Daten ein sog. Risikoprofil für Dich erstellen.

Außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten" findest Du an unserem Stand eine Anleitung, die Dir zeigt wie Du Deiner ePA widersprechen kannst.

Alternativ kannst Du auch unseren Widerspruchsgenerator dafür nutzen, den Du auf unserer Webseite 'https://widerspruch-epa.de' findest.

Zusätzlich kannst Du auch eine Auskunft bei Deiner Krankenasse zu allen dort vorliegenden Daten von Dir machen.

        <abstract>Data about greenhouse gas emissions, both from countries and individual factories, is&#13;
often publicly available. However, the data sources are often not as accessible and&#13;
reliable as they should be. EU emission databases contain obvious flaws, and nobody&#13;
wants to be responsible.</abstract>
        <description>Which factory in my city is the largest emitter of CO2? Which industrial sector is
responsible for the largest share of a country's contribution to climate change? It
should not be difficult to answer these questions. Public databases and reporting
required by international agreements usually allow us to access this data.

However, trying to access and work with these datasets — or, shall we say, Excel tables
— can be frustrating. UN web pages that prevent easy downloads with a "security
firewall", barely usable frontends, and other issues make it needlessly difficult to
gain transparency about the sources of climate pollution.

While working with official EU datasets, the speaker observed data points that could not
possibly be true. Factories suddenly dropped their emissions by orders of magnitude
without any explanation, different official sources report diverging numbers for the
same emission source, and responsible European and National authorities appear not to
care that much.

The talk will show how to work with relevant greenhouse gas emission data sources and
how we can access them more easily by converting them to standard SQL tables. Furthermore, we will dig into some of the
strange issues one may find while investigating emission datasets.

        <abstract>Learn how to find your position using a sextant and a custom slide rule, almost no math required!</abstract>
        <description>Since the dawn of time people have asked themselves: where am I and why am I here?  This talk won't help you answer the why question, but it will discuss how determine the where in the pre-GPS age of sextants, slide rules and stopwatches by taking the noon sight, aka the meridian passage.

The usual way to find your position using the Sun requires a large almanac of lookup tables and some challenging math.  The books are frustrating to consult on every sight and the base 60 degree-minute-second math is frustrating even with a calculator, and if you're on a traditional ship it seems wrong to do traditional navigation with electronic devices.

To speed up the process I’ve designed a specialized circular slide rule that handles most of the table lookups to correct height of eye, semi-diameter, temperature, refraction and index errors, and also simplifies the degree-minute-second arithmetic required to calculate the exact declination of the Sun.

In this talk I’ll demonstrate how to make your own printable paper slide rule and use it to reduce the meridian passage measurement to a lat/lon with just a few rotations of the wheels and pointer, no electronics or bulky books necessary!

        <title>What Makes Bike-Sharing Work? Insights from 43 Million Kilometers of European Cycling Data</title>

        <abstract>Bike- and e-bike-sharing promise sustainable, equitable mobility - but what makes these systems successful? Despite hundreds of cities operating thousands of shared bikes, trip data is rarely public. To address this, we built a geospatial analysis pipeline that reconstructs trip data from publicly accessible system status feeds. Using this method, we gathered **43 million km** of bike-sharing trips across **268 European cities**. Combined with over **100 urban indicators** per city, our analyses reveal how infrastructure, climate, demographics, operations, and politics shape system performance. We uncover surprising insights - such as why some e-bike systems underperform despite strong demand - and highlight how cities can design smarter, fairer mobility. All data and code are open-source, with an interactive demo at [dataviz.nefton.de](https://dataviz.nefton.de/).</abstract>
        <description>We are Felix, Georg, and Martin - each of us working professionally in different research and data areas, ranging from the future of mobility to computational fluid dynamics and machine learning. What unites us is our shared interest in **quantitative traffic analyses**. Building on earlier small-scale studies focused on individual cities, we set out to launch a project that captures shared bike system data across Europe - from regular bikes to e-bikes.

In our study, which led to an **[open-access scientific publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-025-10661-2)**, we scraped shared bike data across Europe at a **minute-by-minute level** over many months, accumulating **more than 43 million records**. We analyze **behavioural and systemic patterns** to understand what makes a bike-sharing system useful and successful within a city. As such, this evidence-based research fits very well with the **39C3 Science track** and the theme of "**Power Cycles**" as we dissect the complex energy and usage cycles that define urban mobility and sustainable futures for everyone. We bridge the gap between urban planning, socioeconomics, and technology by applying statistical modeling and engineering knowledge to a large-scale mined dataset. Join us to learn whether right-wing politics stall sustainable mobility, or which climate e-bikes feel most comfortable in!

We love going the extra mile and therefore provide a live, interactive demo that everyone can use to explore and understand traffic flows: [dataviz.nefton.de](https://dataviz.nefton.de). Therefore, attendees will be able to play with the data in a self-service way. We also provide all code on GitHub and the complete dataset on HuggingFace. And, of course, we will also discuss how both bike-sharing operators and our boss reacted when we told them about the dataset we already had collected (spoiler: lawyers were involved, yet it’s still available for downloads…).

        <abstract>Wer überhaupt „neutral“ sein muss, was das bedeutet, und wer sich jetzt wehren muss.</abstract>
        <description>„Neutralität“ wird zum neuen Kampfbegriff: Weil sie gegen die menschenfeindliche Politik von Friedrich Merz protestieren, wirft die CDU Gruppen wie Omas gegen Rechts, Greenpeace und Correctiv vor, nicht neutral zu sein. Unter Berufung auf ein angeblich verletztes Neutralitätsgebot werden staatliche Förderungen gestrichen und NGOs geraten unter Beobachtung des Verfassungsschutzes.
Julia Klöckner verbietet im Namen der „Neutralität“ Palestine-Shirts, Anstecknadeln und Regenbogenflaggen im Parlament. Die AfD fordert dazu auf, Lehrkräfte zu melden, die sich gegen Rechtsextremismus einsetzen oder entsprechende Positionen innerhalb der AfD kritisieren.
Doch was steckt dahinter?
Was bedeutet das sogenannte Neutralitätsgebot – und für wen gilt es überhaupt?
Und für wen gilt es nicht?
Zivilcourage kann nicht neutral sein – und soll es auch nicht sein. Genauso wie AfD-Hetze gegen Migrant*innen nicht „neutral“ ist, ist die Kritik menschenfeindlicher Äußerungen nicht nur legitim, sondern Pflicht demokratischer Bürger*innen. Das Beschwören eines „Neutralitätsgebots“ für NGOs ist ein durchschaubarer, aber gefährlicher Versuch, sie der eigenen Position zu unterwerfen.
Die Rechtsanwältinnen Vivian Kube und Hannah Vos erklären den verfassungsrechtlichen Hintergrund, zeigen die autoritären Strategien hinter dem Ruf nach „Neutralität“ auf und geben Tipps, wie man sich dagegen wehren kann.
Sie engagieren sich im Projekt Gegenrechtschutz, um demokratische Prinzipien und Betroffene vor rechtlichen Angriffen zu verteidigen.

        <abstract>Nicht zuletzt durch die Werbung in den sozialen Medien werden in Deutschland immer mehr Nahrungsergänzungsmittel verkauft. Einige Influencer bringen sogar ihre eigenen Präparate auf den Markt. Gleichzeitig häufen sich Fälle, in denen die Einnahme von vermeintlich harmlosen „Supplements“ zu Gesundheitsschäden geführt hat. Der Vortrag will daher die Mechanismen hinter dem Supplement-Hype aufzeigen, zudem erklären, warum aktuell ein ausreichender Verbraucherschutz insbesondere im Internet nicht gewährleistet werden kann, wo Handlungsbedarf für die Politik besteht und wie man sich selbst vor fragwürdigen Produkten schützen kann.</abstract>
        <description>Der Markt für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel boomt seit Jahren. Dafür sorgen unter anderem verschiedenste Influencer, die die Präparate in den sozialen Medien bewerben. Statt nur Produkte der großen Player in diesem Bereich anzupreisen, wie More Nutrition, ESN oder Holy Energy, haben einige Influencer mittlerweile sogar ihre eigenen Nahrungsergänzungsmittelmarken auf den Markt gebracht.

Versprochen wird dabei vieles: Pre-Workout-Booster sollen die Leistung beim Krafttraining erhöhen und blitzschnell zum Traumkörper verhelfen, während Gaming-Booster Wachheit und eine Top-Performance beim Zocken versprechen. Wieder andere Kapseln oder auch Gummibärchen sollen für eine makellose Haut oder einen ruhigen Schlaf sorgen. Manche Präparate können angeblich sogar Krankheiten vorbeugen oder heilen.

Doch was steckt tatsächlich in diesen Mitteln, die online regelrecht gehypt werden? Rein rechtlich handelt es sich um Lebensmittel, was wiederum bedeutet, dass sie ohne behördliche Zulassung auf den Markt gebracht werden dürfen. Es genügt schon, wenn der Unternehmer für die Sicherheit garantiert. Die Hürden für einen Marktzutritt sind damit denkbar niedrig, während gleichzeitig Gewinnmargen locken, die sogar den illegalen Drogenhandel übertreffen.

Das Ergebnis zeigt sich in den Berichten der amtlichen Lebensmittelüberwachung: Bei den Proben, die das Niedersächsische Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit im Jahr 2024 untersucht hat, entsprachen rund neun von zehn Proben (89 %) nicht den rechtlichen Vorgaben. Neben Mängeln bei der Kennzeichnung und Bewerbung, wodurch Verbraucher viel Geld für wirkungslose Pulver ausgeben, ist die stoffliche Zusammensetzung der Produkte besonders kritisch. So kann beispielsweise die Einnahme von überdosierten Vitamin-D-Präparaten zu Störungen des Calciumstoffwechsels führen (sog. Hypercalcämien). Vermeintlich harmlose pflanzliche Präparate, wie Kurkuma oder Ashwaganda, können zu Leberschäden bis hin zum Leberversagen führen. Besonders brisant ist dabei, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Erforderlichkeit einer Lebertransplantation oder den Tod des Patienten höher ist als bei Leberschäden durch Arzneimittel (83 vs. 66 %). Es kommen also Menschen durch die Einnahme von Präparaten zu Schaden, mit deren Hilfe sie ihrer Gesundheit eigentlich etwas Gutes tun wollten.

Der Vortrag beleuchtet daher die aktuelle Marktsituation unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Influencer-Marketings kritisch, erklärt den Unterschied zwischen Nahrungsergänzungs- und Arzneimitteln und stellt die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen für das Inverkehrbringen und die Bewerbung von Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln dar. Zudem wird aufgezeigt, warum ein ausreichender Verbraucherschutz durch die aktuellen Möglichkeiten des Lebensmittelrechts insbesondere im Internet nicht gewährleistet werden kann, wo Handlungsbedarf für die Politik besteht und wie man sich selbst vor fragwürdigen Produkten schützen kann.

        <abstract>Sind mehr Infos wirklich die Lösung? Ob Jens Spahn, Philipp Amthor oder Friedrich Merz - sie alle sagen offen, was sie vorhaben und machen keinen Hehl aus ihren Verbindungen zur Trump-Regierung, zu Milliardären und der fossilen Lobby. Was bringt Transparenz in Zeiten der autoritären Wende?</abstract>
        <description>Transparenz braucht Rechenschaft. Ohne Konsequenzen bleibt Transparenz wirkungslos. Wie können wir also eine wirksame Gegenmacht schaffen, die Veränderungen durchsetzt?

Philipp Amthors Angriff aufs Informationsfreiheitsgesetz konnten wir erst einmal abwehren - jetzt geht's in die Offensive! Mit den Highlights aus Strafanzeigen gegen Alexandeer Dobrindt, Spahns geleaktem Maskenbericht, der Milliardärslobby im Wirtschaftsministerium und allen Steueroasen in Deutschland.

        <abstract>Seit Mitte 2025 steht die elektronische Patientenakte für alle zur Verfügung – nach ein paar kleineren oder größeren Sicherheitsproblemen im Vorfeld, sei es vor einem Jahr auf dem 38C3 oder Ende April zum deutschlandweiten Start. &#13;
Zeit ein Fazit zu ziehen: Ist die ePA jetzt sicher? Wurden nachhaltige Veränderungen durchgeführt, die zu mehr Sicherheit führen? Kann der Umgang mit der IT-Sicherheit «eines der größten IT-Projekte der Bundesrepublik» für zukünftige Digitalprojekte hilfreich sein?&#13;
&#13;
Zeit, mit etwas Abstand auf das zu blicken, was war, was ist und was sich abzeichnet nicht nur bei der ePA, sondern auch beim Umgang mit IT-Sicherheit bei ähnlichen Vorhaben in Deutschland. Eine umfassende Analyse der Historie und der Ursachen einer der weitreichendsten Fehlentwicklungen im Bereich der IT-Sicherheit der letzten Jahre, die sich in weit mehr zeigt, als nur in schlechter Prüfung der Anwesenheit von Gesundheitskarten im Gesundheitswesen.</abstract>
        <description>Zum letzten Chaos Communication Congress konnten Martin Tschirsich und Bianca Kastl eine Ansammlung größerer und kleiner Sicherheitsprobleme in der elektronischen Patientenakte für alle aufzuzeigen – sei es in der Ausgabe von Identifikationsmitteln, in Systemen in der Telematikinfrastruktur oder in angebundenen Systemen. All diese Probleme kumulierten in einem veränderten und reduzierten Rollout der ePA für alle in den Modellregionen Anfang 2025, bei dem bereits erste Maßnahmen zur Schadensminimierung unternommen wurden. 
Ende April 2025 wurde die ePA für alle dann auch wirklich für alle deutschlandweit bereitgestellt – allerdings traten am gleichen Tag die scheinbar sicher gelösten Sicherheitslücken im Zugangsmanagement wieder zu Tage und wurden alsbald wieder nur provisorisch abgedichtet.

Dieser Talk will etwas zurückblicken auf die Geschichte und die Ursachen dieser Sicherheitsprobleme der ePA für alle. Als «eines der größten IT-Projekte der Bundesrepublik» steht die ePA sinnbildlich für den digitalpolitischen Umgang mit Sicherheitsversprechen und interessensgetriebenen Anforderungen über die Köpfe von Patient*innen oder Bürger*innen hinweg.

Dabei geht es nicht nur um technische Probleme und deren Behebungsversuche, sondern auch um die strukturellen Ursachen, die große digitale Vorhaben immer wieder in manchen Bereichen scheitern lassen. Diese tiefergehende Betrachtung kann uns dabei helfen, die Ursachen für schlechte IT-Sicherheit auch bei zukünftigen digitalpolitischen Vorhaben in Deutschland besser zu verstehen. Nicht für die ePA für alle und Anwendungen im Bereich der Telematikinfrastruktur, sondern auch weit darüber hinaus.

Tiefergehende Analyse und Nachwirkungen zu 38C3 „Konnte bisher noch nie gehackt werden“: Die elektronische Patientenakte kommt - jetzt für alle!

        <abstract>Agentic AI is the catch-all term for AI-enabled systems that propose to complete more or less complex tasks on their own, without stopping to ask permission or consent. What could go wrong? These systems are being integrated directly into operating systems and applications, like web browsers. This move represents a fundamental paradigm shift, transforming them from relatively neutral resource managers into an active, goal-oriented infrastructure ultimately controlled by the companies that develop these systems, not by users or application developers. Systems like Microsoft's "Recall," which create a comprehensive "photographic memory" of all user activity, are marketed as productivity enhancers, but they function as OS-level surveillance and create significant privacy vulnerabilities. In the case of Recall, we’re talking about a centralized, high-value target for attackers that poses an existential threat to the privacy guarantees of meticulously engineered applications like Signal. This shift also fundamentally undermines personal agency, replacing individual choice and discovery with automated, opaque recommendations that can obscure commercial interests and erode individual autonomy.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will review the immediate and serious danger that the rush to shove agents into our devices and digital lives poses to our fundamental right to privacy and our capacity for genuine personal agency. Drawing from Signal's analysis, it moves beyond outlining the problem to also present a "tourniquet" solution: looking at what we need to do *now* to ensure that privacy at the application layer isn’t eliminated, and what the hacker community can do to help. We will outline a path for ensuring developer agency, granular user control, radical transparency, and the role of adversarial research.</abstract>
        <description>The talk will provide a critical technical and political economy analysis of the new privacy crisis emerging from OS and application level AI agents, aimed at the 39C3 "Ethics, Society &amp; Politics" audience.

1. Defining the Threat: The OS as a Proactive Participant (5 mins)
   We will begin by defining "Agentic AI" in two contexts - imbibed into the operating system and deployed via critical gateway applications such as web browsers. Traditionally, the operating systems and browsers are largely neutral enforcers of user agency, managing resources and providing APIs for applications to run reliably. We will argue that this neutrality is close to being eliminated. The new paradigm shifts these applications into a proactive agent that actively observes, records, and anticipates user actions across all applications.The prime example for this analysis will be Microsoft’s "Recall" feature, Google’s Magic Cue, and OpenAI’s Atlas. Politically, we will frame this not as a "feature" but as the implementation of pervasive, non-consensual surveillance and remote-control infrastructure. This "photographic memory" of and demand for non-differentiated access to everything from private Signal messages to financial data to health data creates a catastrophic single point of failure, making a single security breach an existential threat to a user's entire digital life. Ultimately, we hope to illustrate how putting our brains in a jar (with agentic systems) is effectively a prompt injection attack against our own humanity.

2. The Existential Threat to Application-Level Privacy (10 mins)
   The core of the talk will focus on what this means for privacy-first applications like Signal. We will explain the "blood-brain barrier" analogy: secure apps are meticulously engineered to minimize data and protect communications, relying on the OS to be a stable, neutral foundation on which to build. This new OS trend breaks that barrier. We will demonstrate how OS-level surveillance renders application-level privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, effectively useless. If the OS can screenshot a message before it's encrypted or after it's decrypted, the promise of privacy is broken, regardless of the app's design. We will also discuss the unsustainable "clever hacks" (like Signal using a DRM feature) that developers are forced to implement, underscoring the need for a structural solution.

3. An Actionable Framework for Remediation (20 mins)
   The final, and most important, part of the talk will move from critique to action. We will present an actionable four-point framework as a "tourniquet" to address these immediate dangers:

a. Empower Developers: Demand clear, officially supported APIs for developers to designate individual applications as "sensitive" with the default posture being for such applications being opted-out of access by agentic systems (either OS or application based) (default opt-out)

b. Granular User Control: Move beyond all-or-nothing permissions. Users must have explicit, fine-grained control to grant or deny AI access on an app-by-app basis.

c. Mandate Radical Transparency: OS vendors and application developers must clearly disclose what data is accessed, how it's used, and how it's protected—in human-readable terms, not buried in legalese. Laws and regulations must play an essential role but we cannot just wait for them to be enforced, or it will be too late.

d. Encourage and Protect Adversarial Research: We will conclude by reinforcing the need for a pro-privacy, pro-security architecture by default, looking at the legal frameworks that govern these processes and why they need to be enforced, and finally asking the attendees to continue exposing vulnerabilities in such systems. It was only due to technically-grounded collective outrage that Recall was re-architected by Microsoft and we will need that energy if we are to win this war.

        <abstract>Wer nutzt in Deutschland Software von Palantir und wer hat das in naher Zukunft vor? Was sind die rechtlichen Voraussetzungen für den Einsatz solcher Analysewerkzeuge? Und was plant Innenminister Alexander Dobrindt in Sachen Palantir für die Polizeien des Bundes?</abstract>
        <description>Software von Palantir analysiert für Polizeien und Militär deren Daten – dafür lizenzieren auch deutsche Polizeibehörden seit Jahren die Analysesoftware Gotham des US-Unternehmens. Die Software verarbeitet strukturierte und unstrukturierte Informationen aus Polizeidatenbanken. Die genauen Funktionsweisen sind für die Öffentlichkeit, Gesetzgeber und Kontrollbehörden jedoch nicht einsehbar.

Das US-Unternehmen ist hochumstritten und auch in Deutschland seit einigen Gesetzesinitiativen wieder umkämpft – wegen seiner intransparenten Analysemethoden, seiner Zusammenarbeit mit autoritären Staaten und seiner Nähe zur US-Regierung.

Rechtlich ist der Einsatz von Analysetools wie von Palantir in Deutschland ohnehin komplex, denn das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat 2023 deutliche Grenzen für polizeiliche Datenanalysen gezogen. Dennoch haben mehrere Bundesländer für ihre Polizeien Verträge oder streben sie an. Auch auf Bundesebene wird der Einsatz für das Bundeskriminalamt und die Bundespolizei hitzig diskutiert.

Wie funktioniert Gotham und welche Gefahren gehen damit einher?
Welche Entwicklungen sind  im Bund und in den Ländern zu beobachten? Wie geht es weiter?

Wir wollen über den Stand der Dinge in Bund und Ländern informieren und auch zeigen, wie wir versuchen, rechtliche Vorgaben durchzusetzen. Denn die GFF und der CCC sind an Verfassungsbeschwerden beteiligt, unter anderem in Hessen, Hamburg und zuletzt in Bayern.

        <abstract>Let's have a (hopefully) final look at Diesel emission cheating. This technical talk summarizes what I learned by reverse-engineering dozens of engine ECU software, how I found and characterized "interesting logic" which, more often than not, ended up being a court-approved "defeat device".&#13;
&#13;
What started as a "curious investigation" in 2015 to obtain a ground truth to widespread media reports of "VW being caught for cheating" ended up as a full-blown journey through the then-current state of the Diesel car industry.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, Karsten and Felix will walk through the different implementation of defeat devices, their impact on emissions, and the challenges in documenting seemingly black boxes in court-proven expert reports.</abstract>
        <description>10 years ago, Felix spent a lot of sleepless nights on reverse-engineering the Diesel software that implemented the (by now) well-known "Acoustic Function" defeat device; he presented my findings at the 32c3 and 33c3 in 2015 and 2016, expecting this to be the last time we needed to hear about this.

Little did he know about the extent of the Diesel emissions cheating. Since then he has analyzed many more vehicles, learned a bit or two about mechanical engineering problems of cars.

Karsten, working as a court-appraised expert, will add his unique view on the challenges in documenting software that was never meant to be understood by the public.

This talk will discuss methodologies of independent analysis of highly dynamic systems that many people see as black boxes (but that, of course, are not: they are just machines running software).

        <title>Rowhammer in the Wild: Large-Scale Insights from FlippyR.AM</title>

        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>Last year at 38c3, we gave a talk titled "Ten Years of Rowhammer: A Retrospect (and Path to the Future)."&#13;
In this talk, we summarized 10 years of Rowhammer research and highlighted gaps in our understanding.&#13;
For instance, although nearly all DRAM generations from DDR3 to DDR5 are vulnerable to the Rowhammer effect, we still do not know its real-world prevalence.&#13;
For that reason, we invited everyone at 38c3 last year to participate in our large-scale Rowhammer prevalence study.&#13;
In this year's talk, we will first provide an update on Rowhammer research and present our results from that study. &#13;
&#13;
A lot has happened in Rowhammer research in 2025.&#13;
We have evidence that DDR5 is as vulnerable to Rowhammer as previous generations.&#13;
Other research shows that not only can adversaries target rows, but columns can also be addressed and used for bit flips.&#13;
Browser-based Rowhammer attacks are back on the table with Posthammer and with ECC. fail, we can mount Rowhammer attacks on DDR4 with ECC memory.&#13;
&#13;
In our large-scale study, we measure Rowhammer prevalence in a fully automated cross-platform framework, FlippyR.AM, using the available state-of-the-art software-based DRAM and Rowhammer tools.&#13;
Our framework automatically gathers information about the DRAM and uses 5 tools to reverse-engineer the DRAM addressing functions, and based on the reverse-engineered functions, uses 7 tools to mount Rowhammer.&#13;
We distributed the framework online and via USB thumb drives to thousands of participants from December 30, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Overall, we collected 1006 datasets from 822 systems with various CPUs, DRAM generations, and vendors.&#13;
Our study reveals that out of 1006 datasets, 453 (371 of the 822 unique systems) succeeded in the first stage of reverse-engineering the DRAM addressing functions, indicating that successfully and reliably recovering DRAM addressing functions remains a significant open problem.&#13;
In the second stage, 126 (12.5 % of all datasets) exhibited bit flips in our fully automated Rowhammer attacks.&#13;
Our results show that fully automated, i.e., weaponizable, Rowhammer attacks work on a lower share of systems than FPGA-based and lab experiments indicated, but at 12.5%, are still a practical vector for threat actors.&#13;
Furthermore, our results highlight that the two most pressing research challenges around Rowhammer exploitability are more reliable reverse-engineering tools for DRAM addressing functions, as 50 % of datasets without bit flips failed in the DRAM reverse-engineering stage, and reliable Rowhammer attacks across diverse processor microarchitectures, as only 12.5 % of datasets contained bit flips.&#13;
Addressing each of these challenges could double the number of systems susceptible to Rowhammer and make Rowhammer a more pressing threat in real-world scenarios.</abstract>
        <description>This will be a followup talk after our talk "Ten Years of Rowhammer: A Retrospect (and Path to the Future)" at 38C3.
In the talk last year we gave an overview of the current state of Rowhammer and highlighted that there are no large-scale prevalence studies.
We wanted to change that and asked the audience to participate in our large-scale study on Rowhammer prevalence.

We performed the large-scale study on Rowhammer prevalence thanks to many volunteers supporting our study by measuring their systems.
In total, we collected 1006 datasets on 822 different systems (some systems were measured multiple times).
We show that 126 of them (12.5%) are affected by Rowhammer with our fully-automated setup.
This should be seen as a lower bound, since the preconditions required for effective tools failed on ~50% of the systems.
Among many other insights, we learned that the fully-automated reverse-engineering of DRAM addressing functions is still an open problem and we assume the actual number of affected systems to be higher as the 12.5% we measured in our study.

Now, one year after our talk at the 38C3, we want to give an update on the current state of Rowhammer, since multiple new insights were published in the last year:
The first reliable Rowhammer exploit on DDR5, a JavaScript implementation of Rowhammer that works on current DDR4 systems, and an ECC bypass on DDR4, just to name a few.
Additionally, we want to present the results of our large-scale study on Rowhammer prevalence which was supported by the audience from last year's talk.

        <abstract>PRÜF! Prüfung Rettet übrigens Freiheit!&#13;
Alles wird in Deutschland geprüft. Warum nicht auch mutmaßlich verfassungswidrige Parteien? Hier stelle ich vor, was PRÜF! anders machen will als bisherige Kampagnen.</abstract>
        <description>Wir haben eine Forderung: „Alle Parteien, die vom Verfassungsschutz als rechtsextremer Verdachtsfall oder gesichert rechtsextrem eingestuft werden, sollen durch das Bundesverfassungsgericht überprüft werden.“ Wir demonstrieren so lange, bis der Bundesrat die Prüfung formal beantragt hat. PRÜF-Demos. Bald in allen Landeshauptstädten. Am 2. Samstag. Jeden Monat.

Warum beim Schutz der Demokratie nicht mal einen Ansatz wählen, der so noch nicht probiert wurde? Nicht auf die anderen gucken, sondern auf uns? Auf das gemeinsame? Auf Spaß? Das nutzen, was wir haben und was wir können? Wir haben das Grundgesetz, dessen Stärken eingesetzt werden müssen. Wir haben uns, Millionen Menschen, die wir uns organisieren können. Wir haben Ideen, wir haben Geld, wir haben Macht, wir haben Wissen. Bisher haben wir nicht einmal ansatzweise unsere Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft und es wäre absurd, wenn wir das nicht schaffen würden, die Freiheitliche Demokratische Grundordnung zu schützen.

Vortrag kann Spuren von Prüfen enthalten.

        <abstract>Datenschutz darf auch Spaß machen, und alle können dabei etwas lernen, egal ob Einsteiger oder Profi-Hacker: Bei dem Datenschutz- und Datenpannen-Quiz kämpfen vier Kandidat:innen aus dem Publikum zusammen mit dem Publikum um den Sieg. Nicht nur Wissen rund um IT-Sicherheit und Datenschutz sondern auch eine schnelle Reaktion und das nötige Quäntchen Glück entscheiden über Sieg und Niederlage. Die Unterhaltsame Datenschutz-Quiz-Show mit Bildungsauftrag!</abstract>
        <description>Datenschutz wird oftmals als lästige Pflicht wahrgenommen – aber was will und macht Datenschutz, für was ist er sinnvoll und was ist zu beachten? In welche Stolperfallen können auch Nerds hineinfallen? **Die Datenschutz- und DSGVO-Show vermittelt spielerisch Datenschutzgrundlagen,** bietet einen Einblick in die Praxis der Datenschutz-Aufsichtsbehörden und zeigt typische technische wie rechtliche Fehler im Umgang mit personenbezogenen Daten. Aber auch für Datenschutz-Profis und Superhirne sind einige harte Nüsse dabei.

Der Moderator arbeitet beim Landesbeauftragten für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit Baden-Württemberg und berichtet aus der praktischen Arbeit einer Aufsichtsbehörde, nennt rechtliche Grundlagen, gibt Hinweise zu notwendigen technischen Maßnahmen nach Artikel 32 DS-GVO und die oftmals schwierige Risikoabschätzung nach „wir wurden gecybert“-Sicherheitsvorfällen.

Im Quiz selbst müssen die Kandidat:innen in ihren Antworten praktische Lösungsvorschläge für häufige technische und rechtliche Probleme vorschlagen, zum Beispiel welche technischen Maßnahmen bei bestimmten Datenpannen nach dem „Stand der Technik“ angebracht sind, ob man als Website-Betreiber denn nun Google Analytics nutzen darf oder wie man sich gegen (rechtswidrige) Datensammler wehrt. Dadurch können Teilnehmer wie Zuschauer die praktische Anwendung der DS-GVO spielerisch lernen.

        <abstract>3D-Printers have given us all the unprecedented ability to manufacture mechanical parts with a very low barrier to entry.  The only thing between your idea and its physical manifestation is the process of designing the parts. However, this is actually a topic of incredible depth: Design engineering is a whole discipline to itself, built on top of tons and tons of heuristics to produce shapes that are functional, strong, and importantly: well-manufacturable&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, I will present the rules for designing well-printable parts and touch on other areas of design considerations so you can learn to create parts that work first try and can be reproduced by others on their 3d-printers easily.</abstract>
        <description>Over the years, the 3d-printing community has discovered many tricks and rules that help creating parts that can be printed well and fulfill their purpose as best as possible. I started collecting these rules and wrote an article guide to make this knowledge more accessible. I want to present the most important principles and the mindset that is needed to achieve perfected design.

This is not about how to use a CAD program to design a part — but rather about the thought process of the design engineer while drawing up a part.  A though process that consists of compromises between many objectives, of heuristic rules, and many neat little tricks.

The article that this talk is based on can be found on my blog: https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/

        <abstract>when datasets are scaled up to the volume of (partial) internet, together with the idea that scale will average out the noise,  large dataset builders came up with a human-not-in-the-loop, cheaper-than-cheap-labor method to clean the datasets: heuristic filtering. Heuristics in this context are basically a set of rules came up by the engineers with their imagination and estimation to work best for their perspective of “cleaning”. Most datasets use heuristics adopted from existing ones, then add some extra filtering rules for specific characteristics of the datasets. I would like to invite you to have a taste together of these silent, anonymous yet upheld estimations and not-guaranteed rationalities in current sociotechnical artifacts, and on for whom these estimations are good-enough, as it will soon be part our technological infrastructures.</abstract>
        <description>In 1980s, non-white women’s body size data was categorized as dirty data when establishing the first women's sizing system in US. Now in the age of GPT, what is considered as dirty data and how are they removed from massive training materials?

Datasets nowadays for training large models have been expanded to  the volume of (partial) internet, with the idea of “scale averages out noise”, these datasets were scaled up by scrabbling whatever available data on the internet for free then “cleaned” with a human-not-in-the-loop, cheaper-than-cheap-labor method: heuristic filtering. Heuristics in this context are basically a set of rules came up by the engineers with their imagination and estimation that are “good enough” to remove “dirty data” of their perspective, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational.

The talk will show some intriguing patterns of “dirty data” from 23 extraction-based datasets, like how NSFW gradually equals to NSFTM (not safe for training model), and reflect on these silent, anonymous yet upheld estimations and not-guaranteed rationalities in current sociotechnical artifacts, and ask for whom these estimations are good-enough, as it will soon be part our technological infrastructures.

        <abstract>Die Teckids-Gemeinschaft bringt Kinder, Jugendliche und Erwachsene zusammen, um gemeinsam aktiv für eine verstehbare (digitale) Welt zu sein.</abstract>
        <description>Bei Teckids geht es nicht "nur" um Technikbasteln und Programmieren mit Kindern, sondern darum, mit anderen, für andere, bei Events und gesellschaftlich aktiv zu werden.

In letzter Zeit haben wir viele Projekte dafür unternommen. Unter anderem haben wir den neuen Themen-Slot "Jung und überwacht" bei den BigBrotherAwards 2025 gestaltet und bereiten Jugendthemen für das nächste Jahr vor. Zum zweiten Mal laden wir beim 39c3 Kinder beim Fairydust-Türöffner-Tag "hinter die Kulissen" der Chaos-Teams ein.

Unser Slogan mit dem etwas merkwürdigen Wort "Verstehbarkeit" steht dafür, dass alle nicht nur die Fähigkeiten, sondern auch das Recht behalten sollen, mit ihrer Technik zu machen, was sie wollen, und alles zu hinterfragen und zu verstehen. Dafür wollen wir noch mehr junge Menschen und auch Erwachsene erreichen.

        <abstract>Humanity has already crossed the point where simply reducing emissions will no longer be enough to keep global warming below 2°C. According to the IPCC (AR6, WGIII), it is now essential to actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to meet global climate targets, maintain net-zero (or even net-negative emissions), and address the burden of historical emissions. At the same time, degraded soils and the climate crisis are a threat to global food security.&#13;
Two years ago, I presented an overview of different methods available for carbon dioxide removal. Today, I want to show you an example of how CO₂ can be removed from the atmosphere while simultaneously improving the lives of local communities:&#13;
&#13;
Human shit.&#13;
&#13;
Human shit is a high abundant biomass, contains critical nutrients for global food security, and causes serious health and environmental issues from poor or non-existent treatment outside industrial countries. Converting shit into biochar presents a powerful solution: the process eliminates contaminants, stabilizes and locks away carbon, and can be used to improve agricultural soils. The challenge is that most nutrients in this biochar are not accessible to plants. To overcome this, I mixed human and chicken shit and produced a “Superchar” that releases far more nutrients. It’s not magic, it’s just some chemistry and putting aside your prejudices and disgust. I’ll show you how I did some shit experiments in Hamburg and Guatemala and how you can do it too.</abstract>
        <description>Today’s science mostly follows worn-out pathways and lack big discoveries and innovations. Scientists often don’t want to take a risk because the competition for a permanent position in academia is so high, which pressures them into conservative research topics supported by their supervisors. Even when science provides helpful solutions for urgent problems, the knowledge mostly ends up in libraries, written in papers that nobody understands. I want to show that it is worthwhile to follow research ideas that are unconventional, upset your boss af and explore topics that are unpopular like working with shit. I hope that sharing stories of how a funny idea turned into a solution encourage others to start making impact in their environment.

        <abstract>Die automatisierten Zielsysteme des israelischen Militärs zeigen gut, wie KI-baserte Kriegsautomatisierung aktuell aussieht, was daran falsch läuft und warum wir Techies uns einmischen müssen</abstract>
        <description>Das Thema „KI in der Militärtechnik“ und die Beziehung zwischen Mensch und Maschine ist seit Jahrzehnten ein Thema in der Friedensbewegung, der Konfliktforschung, der Philosophie, den Sozialwissenschaften und den kritischen Data &amp; Algorithm Studies. Doch in den letzten Jahren wurden Waffensysteme mit KI-Komponenten entwickelt und auch praktisch in bewaffneten Konflikten eingesetzt. Dabei reicht die Anwendung von Drohnensteuerung über optische Zielerfassung bis hin zur logistischen Zielauswahl. Am Beispiel KI-gestützter Zielwahlsysteme, die vom israelischen Militär seit Mai 2021 und insbesondere jetzt im Genozid in Gaza eingesetzt werden, können die aktuellen technischen Entwicklungen aufgezeigt und analysiert werden. Im Fokus dieses Talks stehen vier KI-unterstützte Systeme: Das System Gospel zur militärischen Bewertung von Gebäuden, das System Lavender zur militärischen Bewertung von Personen, das System Where's Daddy? zur Zeitplanung von Angriffen und ein experimentelles System auf Basis großer Sprachmodelle zur Erkennung militärisch relevanter Nachrichten in palästinensischen Kommunikationsdaten.

Auf Basis der Aussagen von Whistleblower:innen des israelischen Militärs und Angestellten beteiligter Unternehmen wie Amazon, Google oder Microsoft sowie internen Dokumenten, die durch investigative Recherchen von mehreren internationalen Teams von Journalist:innen veröffentlicht wurden, können die Systeme und Designentscheidungen technisch detailliert beschrieben, kritisch analysiert sowie die militärischen und gesellschaftlichen Implikationen herausgearbeitet und diskutiert werden. Dabei entstehen auch Fragen bezüglich Verantwortungsverlagerung durch KI, Umgehung des Völkerrechts sowie die grundsätzliche Rolle von automatisierter Kriegsführung.

Am Schluss geht der Vortrag noch auf die Verantwortung von IT-Fachleuten ein, die ja das Wissen und Verständnis dieser Systeme mitbringen und daher überhaupt erst problematisieren können, wenn Systeme erweiterte oder gänzlich andere Funktionen erfüllen, als öffentlich und politisch oft kommuniziert und diskutiert wird. Überlegungen zu Handlungsoptionen und Auswegen leiten zuletzt die Diskussion ein.

        <abstract>3 years ago, 3 Maltese students were arrested and charged with computer misuse after disclosing a vulnerability to a local company that developed a mobile app for students. Through persistent media pressure, the students managed to obtain a presidential pardon to drop the case and funding for their lawyers. However, through this journey, there were mentions of punishment for retaliating through media disclosure. The story has not concluded, and there will be no amendments to the Maltese computer misuse law for the foreseeable future.</abstract>
        <description>The talk goes through the full journey,

1. The talk describes in more detail how the arrests were carried out on November 12th, 2022 including the confiscation of all computer equipment, the time spent in a cell and the interrogation before being released.
2. How the decision was made to go to the media 5 months later, the consequences of that and why it was beneficial.
3. The later fallout including the university disassociating itself from the students + even disallowing one of the students to tutor at the university
4. How this led to a pause in Malta's participation in the European Cyber Security Challenge with one specific meeting involving the national IT agency and the 3 students.
5. mentions of a grant of a pardon after the prime minister visited the office of a student
6. The start of the initial court sessions and the outcomes from that.
7. A super interesting meeting where the justice minister told the students that even though they'll be given a pardon -- if this happens again they will be arrested again.
8. What it meant to get a pardon and how that technically still hasn't ended our situation in court yet.

        <abstract>The French ISP 'Free' was the first to introduce a set-top box in France in 2002, named the Freebox. Four years later, the fifth version of the Freebox was released and distributed to customers. It comprises two devices: a router, and a PVR called the Freebox HD, both running Linux. The Freebox HD had innovative features at the time, such as live television control and HD capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Such a device has a lot of potential for running homebrew, so I decided to hack it. I present how I got arbitrary code execution on the Freebox HD and then root privileges, using a chain of two 0-day exploits, one of which is in the Linux kernel. I then analyze the device, run homebrew software, and explain the structure of the ISP's private network that I uncovered while exploring the device.</abstract>
        <description>The Freebox HD is a set-top box with media player capabilities designed and built by the French ISP 'Free' in 2006, and distributed to customers since (including me). It is still in use and will be maintained until the end of 2025.

When I got it, I wanted to run homebrew software on it, so I decided to reverse engineer it. The initial goal was to get arbitrary code execution. The Freebox HD being largely undocumented, this talk shows the full process of reverse engineering it from scratch:
* Initial visual inspection
* Disassembly and inspection of the insides
* Attack surface analysis and choice of the target
* Search and exploitation of a vulnerability in PrBoom (a Doom source port running on the Freebox HD)
* Analysis of the Linux system running on the Freebox HD
* Search and exploitation of a Linux kernel exploit to escape the sandbox and gain root privileges
* Decryption and dump of the firmware
* Analysis of the Linux system and the programs of the Freebox HD
* Playing with the remote control capabilities
* Reverse engineering of the private networks of the ISP

The two exploits used to gain full root access were both discovered for this specific hack, which makes them 0-day exploits.

The analysis leads to some interesting discoveries about the device itself, but also the ISP, how their technical support works and accesses the devices remotely, and much more!

        <title>Build a Fake Phone, Find Real Bugs: Qualcomm GPU Emulation and Fuzzing with LibAFL QEMU</title>

        <abstract>Mobile phones are central to everyday life: we communicate, entertain ourselves, and keep vast swaths of our digital lives on them. That ubiquity makes high-risk groups such as journalists, activists, and dissidents prime targets for sophisticated spyware that exploits device vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
On Android devices, GPU drivers have repeatedly served as the final escalation vector into the kernel. To study and mitigate that risk, we undertook a research project to virtualize the Qualcomm Android kernel and the KGSL graphics driver from scratch in QEMU. This new environment enables deep debugging, efficient coverage collection, and large-scale fuzzing across server farms, instead of relying on a handful of preproduction devices.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will highlight the technical aspects of our research, starting with the steps required to boot the Qualcomm mobile kernel in QEMU, all the way up to the partial emulation of the GPU. Then, we will present how we moved from our emulation prototype to a full-fledged fuzzer based on LibAFL QEMU.</abstract>
        <description>Mobile phone manufacturers ship competitive hardware supported by increasingly complex software stacks, ranging from firmware and bootloaders to kernel modules, hypervisors, and other TrustZone environments. In an effort to keep their products secure, these companies rely on state-of-the-art testing techniques such as fuzzing. They commonly perform their fuzzing campaigns on-device to find vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, this approach is expensive to scale and does not always provide fine-grained control over the target. To address these issues, we approached the problem through the prism of emulation, by partially reimplementing the hardware as a normal software to run on a computer. That way, we could scale fuzzing instances, and gain full control over the emulated target.

The presentation will outline how we made the full emulation of Qualcomm’s Android ecosystem possible by tweaking the complex build system of the Android image and implementing a custom board (including more than 10 custom devices) in QEMU. We will review the steps required and the technical challenges encountered along the way.

After providing a quick recap and the latest updates on LibAFL QEMU (presented at 37C3) by one of the LibAFL maintainers, we will delve into the gory details of how we partially emulated the latest version of Adreno—the GPU designed by Qualcomm—and built a fuzzer for its Android kernel driver. In particular, we will show how LibAFL QEMU was integrated into our custom board and the few improvements we made to the kernel to get better coverage with KCOV. Finally, we will demonstrate how our approach enabled us to find a new critical vulnerability in the GPU kernel driver.

        <abstract>Im Osten stehen nächstes Jahr schon wieder Wahlen an und schon wieder sieht alles danach aus, als ob die AfD eine Regierungsbeteiligung bekommen könnte. Ganz konkret: In Sachsen-Anhalt und Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Nicht nur diese "rosigen" Aussichten, sondern auch aktuelle Bevölkerungsprognosen werfen gar kein günstiges Licht auf die Regionen. Linke Akteur:innen vor Ort kämpfen täglich dagegen an und sie brauchen unsere Solidarität. Wir müssen dem etwas entgegensetzen. Egal ob als Hacker:innen auf dem Congress oder Westdeutsche in (noch) Grünen Gemeinden. &#13;
&#13;
Wo kommt das alles her? Wer macht aktuell etwas dagegen und wie können wir dem rechten Sog begegnen?</abstract>
        <description>Mit dem „Super-Ost-Wahljahr“ 2024 (Landtagswahlen in Sachsen, Thüringen und Brandenburg) wurden bereits alle möglichen AfD-Regierungs-Horrorszenarien in Ostdeutschland in den Medien diskutiert und ausgemalt. Nächstes Jahr stehen jedoch noch die Landtagswahlen in Sachsen-Anhalt und Mecklenburg-Vorpommern an. Und die Prognosen sehen auch dort übel aus. Wären morgen Wahlen, würde die AfD in Sachsen-Anhalt 39% der Stimmen und in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 38% bekommen. Um dem etwas entgegenzusetzen müssten wüste Bündnisse aus CDU, Die Linke, SPD und BSW entstehen. Kurzum: LSA und MV sind verloren!

Zusätzlich schrumpfen beide Bundesländer und altern gleichzeitig. In Sachsen-Anhalt gibt es keinen einzigen „wachsenden“ Ort. Weniger Kinder, immer mehr ältere Menschen, Fachkräftemangel und ein „Männerüberschuss“ – wer will da schon noch Leben und dem rechten Sog die Stirn bieten? Emanzipatorische Akteur:innen verlassen das Land, denn sie werden angegriffen und kriminalisiert. Also: Mauer drum und sich selbst überlassen? Ganz nach dem alten Tocotronic Song „Aber hier Leben? Nein danke!“

Wir wollen den Osten aber nicht aufgeben, deshalb beleuchten wir in unserem Talk, wie wir mit einer gemeinsamen Kraftanstrengung die Mauer vermeiden können – denn es gibt sie (noch): Die Gegenstimmen und Linken Aktiven die in beiden Bundesländern täglich die Fähnchen hochhalten. Ob die „Zora“ in Halberstadt, das „AZ Kim Hubert“ in Salzwedel oder das „Zentrum für Randale und Melancholie“ in Schwerin: Sie organisieren Austauschräume, alternative Konzerte und Orte, die für alle Menschen offen sind. Sie brauchen unseren Support und wir zeigen euch Möglichkeiten wie dieser aussehen könnte.

Außerdem wollen wir ins Gespräch kommen. Was hat eigentlich „der Westen“ mit all dem zu tun? Warum können wir es uns nicht länger leisten unpolitisch oder inaktiv zu sein? Wie kann die Chaos-Bubble sich in die ostdeutschen Herzen hacken? Und was können wir alle tun, um gemeinsam zu preppen und uns den Herausforderungen zu stellen?

        <abstract>WhiteDate ist eine Plattform weißer Suprematist:innen, die sich an Rassist:innen und Antisemit:innen richtet – und auf veralteter Infrastruktur basiert. Was die 8000 Mitglieder nicht wussten: Einige der Nazis flirteten dieses Jahr mit realistisch wirkenden Chatbots -  und verliebten sich sogar in sie. Mit einer Kombination aus automatisierter Konversationsanalyse, Web-Scraping und klassischen OSINT-Methoden verfolgten wir öffentliche Spuren und identifizierten die Personen hinter der Seite. Dieser Vortrag zeigt, wie KI-Personas und investigatives Denken extremistische Netzwerke aufdecken und wie Algorithmen gegen Extremismus eingesetzt werden können.</abstract>
        <description>Monatelang tauchte Martha in die verborgene Welt von WhiteDate, WhiteChild und WhiteDeal ein, drei Plattformen, die von einer Rechtsextremistin aus Deutschland betrieben werden. Sie glaubt an die Verschwörung einer weißen Vorherrschaft und einer „rassisch reinen“ weißen Gemeinschaft.  Was als Neugier begann, entwickelte sich schnell zu einem Experiment über menschliches Verhalten, Technologie und Absurdität.

Martha infiltrierte das Portal mit „realistischen“ KI-Chatbots. Die Bots waren so überzeugend, dass sie die Überprüfungen umgingen und sogar als „weiß“ verifiziert worden. Durch die Gespräche und Recherche von digitalen Spuren dieser Gemeinschaft, die sich in Sicherheit wähnte, konnte sie Nutzer identifizieren.

Gemeinsam mit Reporter:innen der „Die Zeit“ konnten wir die Person hinter der Plattform enttarnen und ihre Radikalisierung von einer erfolgreichen Pianistin zu einer Szene-Unternehmerin nachzeichnen. Um ihr Dating-Portal hat sie ein Netzwerk von Websites aufgebaut, dass seinen Nutzern Liebe, Treue und Tradition vermarktet. WhiteDate verspricht romantische Beziehungen, WhiteChild propagiert Familien- und Abstammungsideale und WhiteDeal ermöglicht berufliches Networking und „gegenseitige Unterstützung“ unter einem rassistischen Weltbild. Gemeinsam zeigen sie, wie Ideologie und Einsamkeit auf bizarre Weise miteinander verwoben sein können.

Nach monatelanger Beobachtung, klassischer OSINT-Recherche, automatisierter Gesprächsanalyse und Web-Scraping haben wir herausgefunden, wer hinter diesen Plattformen steckt und wie ihre Infrastruktur funktioniert. Dabei deckten wir die Widersprüche und Absurditäten extremistischer Gemeinschaften auf, verdeutlichten ihre Anfälligkeit für technologische Eingriffe und brachten sogar den einen oder anderen Nazi zum Weinen.

Dieser Vortrag erzählt von Beobachtung, Schabernack und Einblicken in die digitale Welt extremistischer Gruppen. Er zeigt, wie Algorithmen, KI-Personas und investigatives Denken Hass entlarven, seine Narrative hinterfragen und seine Echokammern aufbrechen können. Wir zeigen, wie Technologie im Kampf gegen Extremismus eingesetzt werden kann.

        <abstract>Oder: Wie die Hamburger Polizei queere Menschen auf öffentlichen Toiletten observierte, und wie ein anonymes Kollektiv im Juli 1980 dieses Überwachungsystem wortwörtlich mit dem Hammer zerschlagen hat. Ein analoger Überwachungskrimi mit sauberen Städten, lichtscheuen Elementen, queerem Aktivismus, und kollektiver Selbstorganisation; und mit einer Anleitung wie man Beamten Anfang der 80er das Handwerk legen konnte.</abstract>
        <description>In den 1970er Jahren nutzt die Hamburger Polizei auf zehn öffentlichen Herrentoiletten in der Wand eingelassene Spionspiegel, um zu beobachten welche Männer am Pissoir ihrer Meinung nach etwas zu lange nebeneinander stehen. In einem Überwachungszeitraum von gut 18 Jahren sprechen Hamburger Beamte mit Berufung auf ‚Jugendschutz‘ und ‚Sauberkeit‘ hunderte Hausverbote an öffentlichen Toiletten aus, nehmen Personalien auf und legen dabei illegalerweise ‚Rosa Listen‘ genannte Homosexuellenregister an. 
Die unfreiwillige Peep-Show endet im Sommer 1980, als die Polizei völlig indiskret die Teilnehmenden der ersten lesbisch-trans-schwulen Demonstration in Hamburg fotografiert um nach Selbstaussage „die Karteien aufzufrischen“. Ein anonymes Kollektiv zerschlägt die Überwachungsspiegel und bringt die illegale Polizeipraxis ans Licht der Öffentlichkeit.
Mit zwei Fragen tauchen wir in diesem Vortrag in die Aborte der Geschichte: Wie ist das polizeiliche Toilettenüberwachungssystem in Hamburg entstanden? Welche technischen und sozialen Lücken nutzten die Aktivist:innen für den Exploit dieses Systems? Und was hat das eigentlich mit heute zu tun?

        <abstract>Eine zwar profane Methode der Überwachung, die Polizeibehörden in Deutschland jedoch hunderttausendfach anwenden, ist das Auslesen von Daten beschlagnahmter Smartphones und Computer. Dazu nutzt die Polizei Sicherheitslücken der Geräte mithilfe forensischer Software von Herstellern wie Cellebrite oder Magnet aus. Die Verfassungsmäßigkeit der Rechtsgrundlagen ist zweifelhaft. Im Vortrag werden anhand aktueller Fälle technische und juristische Hintergründe erörtert.</abstract>
        <description>Staatstrojaner, Chat-Kontrolle, Wanzen. Die Mittel staatlicher Überwachung sind vielfältig und teilweise technisch sehr komplex. Dabei ist es leicht, den Überblick zu verlieren. Ein relativ profanes Mittel, das Polizeibehörden in Deutschland hunderttausendfach anwenden, ist die Beschlagnahme von Smartphones und Laptops sowie das Auslesen ihrer Daten. Genaue Statistiken gibt es nicht. Es dürften jedoch mehr Fälle sein als bei der einfachen Telekommunikationsüberwachung. Allein in Sachsen-Anhalt waren es innerhalb von fünf Jahren 13.000 Smartphones.

Auch bei leichten Straftaten und Ordnungswidrigkeiten beschlagnahmt die Polizei regelmäßig Datenträger - insbesondere Smartphones und Laptops - etwa beim Verdacht einer Beleidigung oder bei der Handynutzung im Straßenverkehr. Oft werden auch Hausdurchsuchungen durchgeführt und dabei alle technischen Geräte beschlagnahmt und durchsucht. Die Verfassungsmäßigkeit dieser polizeilichen Praxis ist sehr zweifelhaft. Das Bundesinnenministerium plante in der letzten Legislatur sogar, die Kompetenzen der Polizei auszuweiten wodurch auch heimliche Hausdurchsuchungen möglich werden sollten. Damit könnte die Polizei heimlich Staatrojaner installieren oder sog. Evil-Maid-Angriffe vorbereiten. Die Strafverfolgungsbehörden stützen sich auf die Beschlagnahmevorschriften der §§ 94 ff. Strafprozessordnung, die seit 1877 im Wesentlichen unverändert geblieben sind und in ihrem Wortlaut weder die Möglichkeit eines Datenzugriffs noch die Modalitäten und Grenzen einer Datenauswertung regeln. Auch wird die Maßnahme nicht auf Straftaten einer gewissen Schwere begrenzt und es fehlen Vorgaben zum Schutz besonders sensibler Daten, die etwa in den Kernbereich der persönlichen Lebensführung fallen. Im Rahmen einer Durchsuchung ermöglicht es der §§ 110 Strafprozessordnung eine vorläufige Sicherung und Durchsicht der Speichermedien. Auch diese Vorschrift reicht nicht aus, um Grundrechte angemessen zu schützen, da mit der kompletten Ausforschung des gesamten Datenbestandes ein gravierender Grundrechtseingriff in die Privatsphäre der Betroffenen verbunden ist und gesetzlich keine angemessenen Grenzen gesetzt werden.

Gerade auf Smartphones befinden sich oft höchstpersönliche Daten wie Chats mit der Familie oder dem*der Partner*in, Fotos, Kontakte, Standortdaten und Dating-Apps. Darüber hinaus sind die Geräte regelmäßig mit Cloud-Diensten und anderen Datenträgern verbunden. Auf all diese Daten können Polizeibehörden dann zugreifen.
Möglich wird das durch Software von Firmen wie Cellebrite, MSAB oder Magnet. Diese nutzen Sicherheitslücken aus, um die Verschlüsselung von Smartphones zu knacken. Wie auch bei Sicherheitslücken für Staatstrojaner sind die Sicherheitslücken, die diese Firmen ausnutzen, den Herstellern nicht bekannt. Damit unterstützen deutsche Behörden ein System, dass die Geräte aller unsicher macht. Auch die Bitlocker-Verschlüsselung von Windows-Computern lässt sich oft umgehen. Dies ermöglicht den Strafverfolgungsbehörden den freien und unbeschränkten Zugang zu allen persönlichen Daten, ohne angemessene gesetzliche oder gerichtliche Kontrolle und Überprüfung. Auch für die betroffenen Personen wird nicht erkennbar, in welchem Ausmaß Daten durchsucht und ausgewertet wurden. Im Vortrag wird der aktuelle Stand und die Probleme von Verschlüsselung von Windows und Linux Computern sowie Android und iOS Smartphones erläutert.

Am Beispiel des Journalisten Hendrik Torners, dessen Smartphone beschlagnahmt wurde, nachdem er eine polizeiliche Maßnahme nach einer Klimademonstration beobachtet hatte und nun im Rahmen einer Verfassungsbeschwerde dagegen vorgeht, sowie weiterer öffentlich diskutierter Fälle wie [#Pimmelgate](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/Pimmelgate) besprechen die Vortragenden die technischen und juristischen Hintergründe.

        <abstract>Join us as we hack at a popular children's smartwatch and expose the secrets of every fifth child in Norway, their parents, and millions more.</abstract>
        <description>Smartwatches for children have entered the mainstream: Advertised on the subway and sold by your cell provider, manufacturers are charging premium prices comparable to an entry-level Apple watch.

In exchange, parents are promised peace of mind: A safe, gentle introduction into the world of technology — and a way to call, text, and locate their child at any time.

But how much are the vendor's promises of safety, privacy, GDPR compliance, apps made in Europe and cloud servers in Germany actually worth?

We take you along the process of hacking one of the most popular children's watches out there, from gaining initial access to running our own code on the watch. Along the way, we find critical security issues at every turn. Our PoC attacks allow us to read and write messages, virtually abduct arbitrary children, and take control over any given watch.

Finally, we'll also talk about disclosure, funny ideas of what passes as a security fix, and how we can use what we found to build something better.

        <abstract>The Tegra X2 is an SoC used in devices such as the Magic Leap One, and Tesla's Autopilot 2 &amp; 2.5 promising a secure bootchain. But how secure really is the secure boot? In this talk I go over how I went from a secured Magic Leap One headset, to exploiting the bootloader over USB, to doing fault injection to dump the BootROM, to finding and exploiting an unpatchable vulnerability in the BootROM's USB recovery mode affecting all Tegra X2s.</abstract>
        <description>In mid 2024, a friend approached me about Magic Leap making their TX2 based XR headsets little more than a paperweight by disabling the mandatory activation servers. I morally dislike this, companies shouldn't turn functional devices into e-waste just because they want to sell newer devices.

After obtaining one, and poking at the Fastboot implementation, I discovered it was based off NVIDIA's Fastboot implementation, which is source available. I found a vulnerability in the NVIDIA provided source code in how it unpacks SparseFS images (named sparsehax), and successfully blindly exploited the modified implementation on the Magic Leap One. I also found a vulnerability in it that allowed gaining persistence via how it loads the kernel DTB (named dtbhax).

Still unsatisfied with this, I used fault injection to dump the BootROM from a Tegra X2 devkit.

In the BootROM I discovered a vulnerability in the USB recovery mode. Exploiting this vulnerability proved difficult due to only having access to memory from the perspective of the USB controller. I will explain what was tried, why it didn't work, and how I eventually got code execution at the highest privilege level via it.

As I will demonstrate, this exploit also functions on Tesla's autopilot hardware.

        <description>In August 2025 Phrack published the dump of an APT member's workstation. The attacker was most likely Chinese, working on targets aligned with North Korea's doctrine. The dump was full of exploits, attacker tools and loot. Data from government networks, cell carriers and telcos, including server databases and loads or private keys stemming from the government PKI. The attacker had maintained a steady foothold in various targets in South Korea and Taiwan before accidentally "losing" their workstation.

The dump sparked a government investigation, and big corporations like LG, Lotte and Korea Telecom were asked to explain themselves. The government also mandated an on-site audit in the data center where the hacks had taken place. On the day of the audit, some li-ion batteries in the data center mysteriously caught fire. The blaze destroyed close to 100 servers (which had no backup) and plunged public service in South Korea into disarray. 
Shortly after, the Lotte data center burned as well - the corporation had been victim of a breach recently, albeit by a different threat actor. In the beginning of October, one of the officers examining the government data center fire tragically died by his own hand.

The talk aims to revisit this mysterious sequence of events that was started by an article in Phrack [#72](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/tag/72). It doesn't hope to give answers or a solution, but narrates a story that could be from a spy thriller. Caution: Conspiracies and technical gore could be present.

        <abstract>Das Bürgergeld ist Geschichte. An seine Stelle tritt eine Grundsicherung, die auf kalkulierten Verfassungsbruch setzt. Totalsanktionen, Vermittlungsvorrang, Quadratmeterdeckel, jeder Move bedeutet umfassendere staatliche Überwachung. Die Bezahlkarte soll in Hamburg perspektivisch zunächst auf Sozialhilfe‑ und Jugendhilfebeziehende ausgeweitet werden. Sind Bürgergeldbeziehende als nächstes dran?</abstract>
        <description>Die neue Grundsicherung trumpft Hartz IV in seiner Grausamkeit und ist ein Damoklesschwert über Erwerbslosen und allen, die Lohnarbeit machen. Zugleich nimmt die Zahl der Milliardäre und Mulitmillionäre stetig zu. Finanzbetrug durch Überreiche wird mehr oder weniger tatenlos zugesehen, während das Phantom des Bürgergeld-Totalverweigerers seit Jahren durch die Medien getrieben wird.

Wie der Angriff auf den Sozialstaat sich auf die Betroffenen in der Praxis auswirkt und was wir als Zivilgesellschaft tun können, um nicht nur tatenlos zusehen zu müssen, darum geht es in diesem Talk.

        <abstract>Das Bridges Kammerorchester hackt die klassische Musikszene, indem es die Regeln des traditionellen Konzertbetriebs aufbricht: Musiker*innen mit und ohne Flucht- und Migrationsbiografie bringen Instrumente wie Oud, Tar, Kamanche oder Daf in die europäische Orchestertradition. Statt überwiegend Werke verstorbener männlicher, europäischer Komponisten zu spielen, komponieren die Mitglieder ihre Musik selbst – ein radikaler Perspektivwechsel hin zu Vielfalt und Selbstbestimmung. Im Vortrag zeigen sie anhand von Hörbeispielen und persönlichen Geschichten, wie diese Hacks entstehen und machen im Anschluss in einem Konzert die musikalische Vielfalt live erlebbar.</abstract>
        <description>Das transkulturelle Bridges Kammerorchester hackt die klassische Musikszene: es bringt Musizierende mit und ohne Flucht- und Migrationsbiografie zusammen und integriert Instrumente und Musikstile in die europäische Orchestertradition, die dort traditionell nicht vorgesehen sind. Neben klassischen Orchesterinstrumenten spielen Instrumente wie Oud, Tar, Tiple, Kaval, Kamanche, Shudraga, Daf und Riq zentrale Rollen.

Ihre Musik komponieren die Orchestermitglieder überwiegend selbst. Auch das ist ein Hack auf die klassische Musikszene, die bisher überwiegend Werke verstorbener männlicher Komponisten interpretiert. So steht die Musik des Bridges Kammerorchester für Vielfalt und Selbstbestimmung und macht die Diversität der in Deutschland lebenden Gesellschaft hörbar. 
Im Vortrag zeigen Mitglieder des Bridges Kammerorchesters anhand von Erfahrungen und Hörbeispielen – live und per Video – wie sie die klassische Musikszene hacken. Sie geben Einblicke in ihren kollektiven, heterogenen Kompositionsprozess, berichten von Freiheiten, Herausforderungen und Erfahrungen mit Publikum und Veranstaltern. Persönliche Migrationsgeschichten verdeutlichen, wie diese die musikalische Perspektive und Identität des Orchesters prägen. Anschließend folgt ein Konzert, das die Vielfalt ihrer Musik erlebbar macht.

        <description>After the [Air France-KLM dataleak](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-lightningtalks-58027-air-france-klm-6-char-short-code) I kept repeating this was not a real hack, and confessed I always wanted to hack a system based on triggering race conditions because the lack of proper transactions.
This was way easier than expected. In this talk I will show how just adding `$ seq 0 9 | xargs -I@ -P10 ..` can break some systems, and how to write safe database transactions that prevent abuse.

In this talk I will explain what race conditions are. Many examples of how and why code will fail. How to properly create a database transaction. The result of abusing this in real life (e.g. free parking).

        <abstract>Science is hard and research into the usage of the Tor network is especially so. Since it was designed to counter suveillance, it gathering reliable information is difficult. As a consequence, the studies we do have, have yielded very different results.&#13;
&#13;
This talk investigates the root causes of contradicting studies by highlighting how slight changes in methodology or data selection completely change the results and thereby our understanding of what the Darknet is. Whether you consider it the last bastion of freedom or a haven of crime, this talk will tell you where to look and what to ignore in order to confirm your current opinion. And in case you are open to changing it, we have some food for thought for you.</abstract>
        <description>Onion services can be considered one of the most controversial aspects of the Tor network, because they allow the anonymous hosting of services, which has enabled the creation of illegal services which are difficult for law enforcement to shut down. Defenders argue that this is a price worth paying to ensure free speech for people who could otherwise not speak up or run their own services.

This obviously raises the question what onion services are being actually used for in practice. Many researchers have tried to answer this question in the past. Based on their work we already know a few things:

- 9% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [1]
- 2.7% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [2]
- 50% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [3]
- 8.4% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [4]
- 27% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [5]
- 34.8% of all Websites on the Darknet are marketplaces [6]

No, this is not a copy and paste error, all of the above statements can be found in peer-reviewed scientific publications. All of these results are valid on their own and constitute valuable contributions to science, but it does not take an expert to notice the contradictions in their findings.  
The reasons for these inconsistencies are the main topic of this talk. We will discuss the information available to researchers and the limitations originating from it. Challenges and current disagreements when it comes to interpreting available data will be addressed along with common misrepresentations of research results. We will highlight how the choice of data sources can predetermine the final result before a study has even begun, how minor changes to definitions can lead to completely different results and how important context is when interpreting data.

Armed with this knowledge, we can tackle the challenge to find out what we know about the Darknet, what we might figure out in the future, what we can reasonably assume but will never be able to prove, and what we will (hopefully) never know.

        <abstract>The Dutch railways have been operating an increasingly complicated network of trains for over 80 years. The task of overseeing it is far too complex for a single human. As such, a network of specifically scoped humans has been connected. Over time, computers and software have been introduced into the system, but today there is still a significant role for humans.&#13;
&#13;
This talk describes the network of "human microservices" that is involved in the Dutch Railways' day to day operation from the eyes of a software developer.</abstract>
        <description>When a train breaks down in the Netherlands, a system of interconnected humans is shifted into gear. The current state of that system has been developed for over 80 years and as such should be seen as an architectural marvel. Even though there is nowadays a significant amount of software involved in the process, the people involved are still very much necessary.

This talk describes the processes and roles involved in the Dutch railway day to day operations. We will start at a broken down train on a busy track and work our way towards solutions including dragging the train, evacuating travelers and redirecting other trains on that trajectory. We will explore this from a software developer's perspective. We will consider the people involved as an ancient form of hardware, and the protocols between them as software. We will also go over the more modern additions to the system: phone lines and software running on actual computers.

After our investigation you will have a new understanding of the complexity of running a railway network. And we will ask ourselves: is this an outdated system that needs to be digitized? Or is this actually a modern system with microservices and a "human in the loop"?

        <abstract>Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities, like Spectre, have been making headlines since 2018. However, their most common critique is that these types of vulnerabilities are not really practical. Even though it is cool to leak `/etc/shadow` with a CPU bug, it has limited real-world impact. In this talk, we take Spectre out for a walk and let it see the clouds, by leaking memory across virtual machine boundaries at a public cloud provider, bypassing mitigations against these types of attacks. Our report was awarded with a $151,515 bug bounty, Google Cloud's highest bounty yet.</abstract>
        <description>Seven years ago, Spectre and Meltdown were announced. These two vulnerabilities showed that instructions executed by the CPU might accidentally access secret data. This secret data can contain files cached from disk, cryptographic keys, private information, or anything else that might be stored in memory. An attacker can use Spectre to learn the value of that secret data, even though the attacker is not supposed to have access to it.

Even though this sounds problematic, there is a reason why these type of vulnerabilities haven't had a significant real-world impact. Mitigations make it much harder to pull off, and an attacker needs a form of remote code execution anyway to trigger the relevant CPU instructions. If an attacker can already execute arbitrary code, then Spectre is probably not what you should be worried about. For regular users, these CPU vulnerabilities are likely not that much of a threat.

However, that is not the case for public cloud providers. Their business model is to provide *remote code execution as a service*, and to rent out shared hardware resources as efficiently as possible. Customers run their system in an seemingly isolated virtual machine on top of shared physical hardware. Because customers can run anything they want on these systems, public cloud providers must treat these workloads as untrusted. They have to assume the worst case scenario, i.e. that an attacker is deliberately trying violate the confidentiality, integrity or availability of their systems, and, by extension, their customers' systems. For transient execution vulnerabilities like Spectre, that means that they enable all reasonable mitigations, and some more.

In this talk, we show that transient execution attacks can be used on real-world systems, despite the deployed software mitigations. We demonstrate this by silently leaking secret data from another virtual machine at a major global cloud provider, defeating virtual machine isolation without leaving a trace. Additionally, we'll discuss our coordinated disclosure process, the currently deployed mitigations and how future mitigations could address the issue.

        <abstract>The talk is about the ideas behind setting up the David Graeber Institute and the Museum of Care. The Survival Kit Collection brings together collectives developing open source "social technologies" —spirulina farms, self-replicating 3D printers, modular housing, low-cost water systems, and ... art and education. In 2019, together with David Graeber, we held the first workshop about the Museum of Care at CCC to reimagine the relation between freedom, technology and value. Over these 6 years, the Museum of Care and the David Graeber Institute have experimented with various projects: the survival collection, Visual Assembly, and creating an open space for horizontal knowledge production—something we hope to develop into an actual University.</abstract>
        <description>We think humanity could already be living in a society of abundance and communal luxury. We have the technologies to produce enough for everyone to have everything. The issue isn't technological but social. This is why we need a Museum (of Care): museums are among the few places that create, distribute, and preserve what a society values.

What will be at the session:
We'll tell in more detail about the concept of the Museum of Care on abandoned ships (of which, according to Maritime Foundation data, there are more than 4,500 in the world). We'll talk about the halls of our museum: the Hall of Giants and other emerging spaces. Projects we're building—spirulina farms, 3D printers—in Saint Vincent (Caribbean) and Kibera Art District, Nairobi Kenya, Playground designed that communities can construct with nearly no resources. Can we actually build a nomadic museum proud not of its unique exhibits but of how easily they spread and get replicated?

Then we will move to an open conversation about what poetic technologies are and how they differ from bureaucratic ones. Some people may have read David Graeber's book The Utopia of Rules; here you can download his other texts that are less widely known or not yet published. We would very much like to explore the question of poetic and bureaucratic technologies together with you. To facilitate this discussion, the David Graeber Institute has invited Alistair Parvin, creator of the Wiki House project, to join Nika Dubrovsky in conversation.

The discussion continues in the format of a Visual Assembly—focused on building a distributed, non-hierarchical, genuinely open University with different ideas of funding and knowledge production. This is the very beginning of the process so all input is very much welcome. We'd welcome any ideas, critiques, or proposals for collaboration.

        <abstract>"Wir gehen nach Karlsruhe!“ – das klang vor zehn Jahren nach Aufbruch und juristischem Hack. Heute ist klar: Strategische Prozessführung ist kein Sprint, sondern ein zähes, manchmal frustrierendes Dauerprojekt.&#13;
&#13;
In diesem Talk ziehen wir Bilanz: Was haben wir mit zivilgesellschaftlichen Verfassungsbeschwerden im Bereich Technologie erreicht – und wo sind wir gescheitert? Welche Fehler würden wir heute vermeiden, welche Wege waren richtig? Und was bedeutet es, wenn das höchste deutsche Gericht zunehmend weniger Lust auf digitalpolitische Grundrechtsfragen zeigt?&#13;
&#13;
Ein realistischer Blick hinter die Kulissen strategischer Klagen – und die Frage: Wie hackt man das Rechtssystem im Jahr 2025?</abstract>
        <description>Wenn Gesetze Grundrechte verletzen, warum nicht das Bundesverfassungsgericht hacken – mit Strategie, Teamwork und guter Begründung? Aus dieser Idee ist inzwischen ein zentrales Werkzeug zivilgesellschaftlicher Gegenmacht geworden: Strategische Prozessführung. Das Prinzip ist einfach: Gesetze nicht nur kritisieren, sondern systematisch angreifen, mit gezielten Verfassungsbeschwerden gegen Überwachung, Zensur und staatliche Eingriffe in die digitale Freiheit.
Seitdem hat sich viel getan. Organisationen wie die Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte (GFF) haben den Weg nach Karlsruhe professionalisiert und Verfahren angestoßen, die viele aus den Nachrichten kennen:
gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung,
gegen das BND-Gesetz zur Auslandsüberwachung,
gegen den Einsatz von Palantir,
und gegen den Einsatz von Staatstrojanern.
Einige dieser Verfahren waren erfolgreich und haben Gesetze gekippt. Andere sind krachend gescheitert – oder hängen seit Jahren in Karlsruhe fest. Dabei zeigt sich: Der Weg zum Urteil wird härter, die Erfolgsaussichten kleiner, und das Verfassungsgericht ist nicht mehr der progressive Motor, der es mal war.
Dieser Talk zieht eine ehrliche Bilanz: Was bringt strategische Prozessführung wirklich? Was lässt sich aus Erfolgen und Misserfolgen lernen? Welche Fälle lohnen sich – und wo wird der Rechtsweg zur Sackgasse? Und wie verschiebt sich das Ganze inzwischen auf die europäische Ebene – wo neue Schauplätze wie der Digital Services Act oder der AI Act warten?
Keine juristische Vorlesung, sondern ein Erfahrungsbericht aus zehn Jahren digitaler Grundrechtsarbeit. Es geht um Taktik, Fehlentscheidungen, unerwartete Allianzen – und um die Frage, wie man auch heute noch im Rechtssystem rütteln kann, wenn die Türen in Karlsruhe enger werden.
Der Vortrag wird gehalten von Simone Ruf und Jürgen Bering von der Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte.

        <abstract>The Vital Bracelet series is an ecosystem of interactive fitness toys, content on memory chips, and apps that talk via NFC. In this talk, we'll explore the hardware and software of the series, from its obscure CPU architecture, to how it interacts with the outside world, from dumping OTP ROMs and breaking security, to making custom firmware.</abstract>
        <description>The Vital Bracelet series, active from 2021 to 2024, was a line of toys that revolved around a number of fitness bracelets that encouraged exercise by raising characters from the Digimon series, and expanding into tokusatsu and popular anime characters later. Think of it as Tamagotchi, but nurturing through exercise instead of button presses.

In this presentation, we'll look at the different parts of this series' ecosystem, how they work, and the different ways to circumvent various security measures and customize the devices' behavior.

We start by looking at the first Vital Bracelet, with a quick introduction to hardware reverse engineering and how to dump firmware out of flash. Following that, we will take a look at the microcontroller used in the devices, and its obscure instruction set architecture. This will lead into an exploration of how to reverse engineer code when you are missing a significant portion of it, and how the embedded ROM was dumped. After this, we will look at the DRM applied to content, and how it was circumvented. Next, the device's NFC capabilities will be explored.

With the release of the Vital Bracelet BE, which introduced upgradable firmware, came new challenges and opportunities. We will take a look at the new content format and additional DRM measures it incorporated, plus how the device's bootloader was dumped despite its signature verification scheme.

Finally, we will take a look at the process for modding the various Vital Bracelet releases, and some techniques to use while writing patches.

The material in this talk can be applied beyond just the Vital Bracelet series, and can be useful if you want to explore other electronic toys, or just hardware reverse engineering in general.

        <abstract>Over the last half year I have explored the Motorola mc14500 - a CPU with a true one-bit architecture - and made it simulate Conway's Game of Life. This talk gives a look into how implementing a design for such a simplistic CPU can work, and how it's possible to address 256 LEDs and half a kiloword of memory with just four bits of address space.</abstract>
        <description>In the late seventies, Motorola created a very cheap CPU, intended to replace logic circuits made from electromechanical relays. The resulting IC is so minimalistic that it can hardly be recognized as a CPU: Its data bus is just a single bit wide, it has no program counter, and the address bus isn't connected to the cpu at all. Yet, with just a few support components, and some clever programming, it can be made to do all sorts of things.

We'll explore hardware design and programming by taking a look at my implementation of Conway's Game of Life, and answer the question of how one can address 512 words of memory, as well as some other peripherals, using just four bits of address space.

Outline:
* History and theory of operation of the mc14500
* Writing programs that process one bit at a time
* A closer look at the hardware I built, including its wacky peripherals
* Demonstration
* Q&amp;A

        <abstract>2025 was a bad year for South Korean mobile network operators. All three operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG U+) were affected by breach in some part of their respective network: HSS of SK Telecom, femtocells of KT. Meanwhile, handling of the breach by each operators and post-mortem analysis of each breaches have stark differences. The technical details and implemented mitigations are often buried under the vague terms, and occasionally got lost in translation to English. In this talk, I will cover the technical aspects of SK Telecom and KT's breach, and how the operators are coping to the breach and what kind of measurements have been performed to secure their network.</abstract>
        <description>This talk will cover the public information and experiments related to the South Korean telco breaches in 2025. This talk will cover SK Telecom's HSS breach (final results announced), KT's femtocell breach (investigation ongoing) and related operator billing fraud, and revisit Phrack report on KT and LG U+ breach. We also give a light on the detail regarding the implemented mitigation and diaster response of each operators.

SK Telecom's HSS breach is attributed to a variant of BPFDoor malware, resulting leakage of critical operator data related to subscriber authentication and accounting. They replaced the SIM cards of all 23 million subscribers, and implemented additional mechanism to track the possible cloning of the SIM card. We analyze the aftermath and how it will effectively protect against the said attack.

KT's femtocell and operator billing breach (investigation still ongoing as the time of writing) is attributed to the mismanagement of KT's femtocell, allowing an external attacker to mimick the behavior of KT's legitimate femtocell and use as a cellular interception device. This is a modern implementation of the remarkable research "Weaponizing Femtocells" back in 2012, and new cellular technologies like VoLTE have changed the possible attack vectors. We provide a possible theory on how the attack would be possible, based on the publicly available information and previous researches.

Finally, we also cover the characteristics of South Korean mobile market and how the media caused the inaccurate analysis and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). In particular, how SMS-based 2FA is tied to personal authentication and how everything is strongly bound to the personal identity. Early media reports could be attributed to the information "lost in translation" and inaccurate information in English-language articles when the details of the breach were not widely shared. We try to correct the information (also in the official incidence report) and showcase how not to report the breach in general.

        <abstract>Die Arktis ist eine Region, in der die Sonne monatelang weg ist, dickes Meereis den Weg versperrt und deshalb Forschungsdaten ziemlich rar sind. Kompliziert also, herauszufinden was im Wasser blüht! Mit einer Kombination aus Satellitenbildern, Expeditionen und Modellsimulationen auf Hochleistungsrechnern versuche ich, das Verborgene sichtbar zu machen: die faszinierende, farbenfrohe Welt des arktischen Phytoplanktons.</abstract>
        <description>Im Arktischen Ozean wird immer deutlicher, wie stark die globale Erwärmung den Rückgang des Meereises und das marine Ökosystem beeinflussen. Winzige Organismen, das Phytoplankton, bilden die Grundlage des Nahrungsnetzes durch den Aufbau von Biomasse und spielen so eine zentrale Rolle im globalen Kohlenstoffkreislauf. Dabei werden sie in der Arktis stark von den jahreszeitlichen Schwankungen der Polarnacht/-tag, der Meereisausdehnung und der sich verändernden Umwelt beeinflusst. Doch das Phytoplankton ist nicht nur ökologisch bedeutsam, sondern auch erstaunlich vielfältig und farbenfroh – wie eine bunte Blumenwiese im Ozean! 
Spannend bleiben dabei auch die Fragen, was die Vielfalt des Phytoplanktons ausmacht, wie diese eine Anpassung an die Umweltveränderungen ermöglicht und wie sich das arktische Ökosystem unter verschiedenen Klimawandelszenarien entwickeln könnte.
Dieser Vortrag lädt euch ein, in die eisigen Welten des arktischen Ozeans einzutauchen, um dem grundlegenden Baustein des arktischen Ökosystems, dem Phytoplankton, auf den Grund zu gehen.

        <abstract>The virus of surveillance is spreading across the European Union. In the form of its "ProtectEU" Internal Security Strategy, the European Commission is planning to attack encryption, re-introduce mandatory data retention and strengthen Europol and Frontex, the main agents of its oppressive law enforcement infrastructure. In this talk, we will journey the wastelands of the EU surveillance apocalypse together: We will take a close look at what politicians are planning to undermine our fundamental rights, the technology involved, and the real harms we must fight. From there, we will chart pathways to resistance and collective immunity against a surveillance agenda that requires us to form new alliances and re-think mobilization.</abstract>
        <description>Admidst its current push to remove the rules that have protected the EU's environment, consumer and fundamental rights, there is one area the European Commission happily calls for more regulation: Internal security. The recent "ProtectEU" Internal Security Strategy does little to protect Europeans, and instead foresees attacks on encryption, the re-introduction of mandatory data retention and the strengthening of Europol and Frontex, the main agents of the EU's oppressive law enforcement infrastructure. In this talk, we will introduce the strategy and its main pillars, explain its political and legal contexts, and take a look at what it would mean for our fundamental rights, access to encryption, and IT security if enacted. But not all hope is lost (yet), and together we want to chart pathways to meaningful resistance. To do so, we will help understand the maze of the EU's lawmaking process and identify pressure points. We will then look back at past fights, lessons learned and new opportunities to act in solidarity against a surveillance agenda that is truly apocalyptic.

        <abstract>Auch in der Schweizer Netzpolitik ging es im auslaufenden Jahr drunter und drüber. Wir blicken mit gewohntem Schalk auf das netzpolitische Jahr 2025 zwischen Bodensee und Matterhorn zurück - und diskutieren jene Themen, die relevant waren und relevant bleiben.</abstract>
        <description>**Themen sind unter anderem:**


**E-ID und E-Collecting:** Die netzpolitische Community hat nicht nur eine privatisierte E-ID verhindert sondern auch den Datenschutz als zentrales Prinzip verankert und einen beispielhaften Gesetzgebungsprozess begleitet. Das Gleiche haben wir bei E-Collecting vor, mit dem wir die direkte Demokratie der Schweiz auf ein neues Level heben wollen.


**Elektronisches Gesundheitsdossier:** Was macht man, um eine Verschlechterung bei einem Produkt zu kaschieren? Richtig, man nimmt ein Rebranding vor. Und so heisst das E-PD nun E-GD.


**Kabelaufklärung:** Im Dezember überraschte uns das Bundesverwaltungsgericht mit einem wegweisenden Urteil: Es beurteilte die Kabelaufklärung als nicht vereinbar mit der Bundesverfassung und der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention. Lässt das ganze aber 5 Jahr laufen.


**What the VÜPF:** Wie die Schweiz zudem plant, das freie Internet weitgehend abzuschaffen. Wie der Stand der Verschärfung ist. Was wir und du dagegen tun können?


**Plattformregulierung:** Ein Vorschlag zur Plattformregulierung wurde vom Bund ausgearbeitet - und nach der Verhängung von 39% Strafzoll still und heimlich in der Schublade versenkt. Doch der Bund fasste Mut - und wagt einen zaghaften Aufbruch.


**KI-Regulierung &amp; Leistungsschutzrecht:** Und wieso getraut sich der Bund, ein Leistungsschuzrecht einzuführen? Und mit der Motion «Gössi» KI-Sprachmodelle mit Schweizer Daten zu gefährden? (Spoiler: wegen der Verleger-Lobby)


**Community in der Schweiz:** Winterkongress, Diversity und andere Aktivitäten.


Nach dem Vortrag sind alle interessierten Personen eingeladen, die [Diskussion in einer self-organized Session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/treffen-der-netzpolitischen-community-der-sch_uoca) fortzusetzen. Es werden Aktivist:innen von verschiedenen Organisationen der Netzpolitik in der Schweiz anwesend sein.

        <title>The Angry Path to Zen: AMD Zen Microcode Tools and Insights</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <abstract>[EntrySign](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5424842357473280/zen-and-the-art-of-microcode-hacking) opened the door to custom microcode on AMD Zen CPUs earlier this year. Using a weakness in the signature verification we can load custom microcode updates and modify behavior of stock AMD Zen 1-5 CPUs. While AMD has released patches to address this weakness on some CPUs, we can still use unpatched systems for our analysis.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk we cover what we found out about microcode, what we saw in the microcode ROM, the tooling we build, how we worked to find out more and how you can write &amp; test your own microcode on your own AMD Zen systems. We have our tools up on [GitHub](https://github.com/AngryUEFI) for everyone to play around with and hopefully help us understand microcode more than we currently do.</abstract>
        <description>Modern CPUs often translate the complex, user visible instruction set like x86_64 into a simpler, less feature rich internal instruction set. For simple instructions this translation is done by a fast path decoding unit. However some instructions, like `wrmsr` or `rdrand` are too complex to decode that way. These instructions instead are translated using a microcode decoder that can act almost like an execution engine. The microcode decoder still emits internal instructions into the pipeline, but allows for features like conditional branches and calls &amp; returns. All of this logic happens during a single x86_64 instruction and is usually hidden from the outside world. At least since AMD K8, launched in 2003, AMD CPUs allowed updating this microcode to fix bugs made in the original implementation.

Building on our [previous](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9058-everything_you_want_to_know_about_x86_microcode_but_might_have_been_afraid_to_ask) [experience](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9614-inside_the_amd_microcode_rom) with AMD K8 &amp; K10 microcode and [EntrySign](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5424842357473280/zen-and-the-art-of-microcode-hacking) [published](https://media.ccc.de/v/why2025-156-entrysign-create-your-own-x86-microcode-for-fun-and-profit) earlier this year, we took a closer look at AMD Zen 1-5 CPUs. We build on top of [Zentool](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/entrysign/zentool) to understand more instructions and created a set of tools to easily create microcode patches as well as apply them on CPUs. We can modify the behavior of instructions and observe some usually not visible internal state by supplying our own microcode update.

Like on K8, we extracted the physical ROM on the CPU using an electron microscope to read the hardcoded microcode on a Zen 1 CPU. Using the understanding of the microcode encoding we could then start disassembling the contents and understand how some instructions are implemented. While there are still a lot of things we don't understand, we could follow control flow and analyze algorithms like the XXTEA decryption of the microcode update.

To start off this work, we implemented a set of tools that allow easy testing of microcode updates without the need for a fully featured OS. That way we can run timing tests with low noise and don't risk data corruption if we corrupt a vital instruction. To continue our naming scheme from our work on K8 we dubbed this the AngryTools, all of them available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AngryUEFI). The core components are a UEFI application running from RAM, AngryUEFI, and a Python framework for test writing on a client computer, AngryCAT. AngryUEFI starts on the test system and waits for AngryCAT tests supplied via TCP. These tests usually consist of a microcode update that gets loaded on the target CPU core and a buffer with x64 instructions that get run afterwards. AngryUEFI then sends back information about the test execution. AngryUEFI also recovers most faults caused by invalid microcode, often even allowing reuse of a CPU core after a failed test run. We also added some syscall-like interfaces to support more complex data collection like [IBS](https://reflexive.space/zen2-ibs/).

To make it easier to write custom microcode updates we also implemented [ZenUtils](https://github.com/AngryUEFI/ZenUtils), a set of Python tools. So far we support single line assembly and disassembly based on architecture specification for Zen 1 &amp; 2 with limited support for other Zen architectures. We also include a macro assembler that can create a full microcode update from an assembly-like input file. Later we will also extend ZenUtils with utilities to sign and en/decrypt microcode updates. Currently we rely on Zentool for these tasks.

We also show some basic examples of how microcode programs work, from a simple CString strlen implementation in a single x64 instruction to a [subleq](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subleq) VM implemented entirely in microcode. These show off the basics of microcode programming, like memory loads &amp; stores, arithmetic and conditional branches. We are also currently looking at other examples and more complex programs.

We hope this talk shows you how to start throwing random bits at your own AMD Zen CPU to figure out what each bit does and help us in further understanding the instruction set. We welcome improvements to the tooling and even entirely new tools to help analyze microcode updates and the ROM.

If you are already familiar with EntrySign, we only cover the very basics of it and focus more on what we learned after having a foothold in the microcode.

        <abstract>Hegemony Eroding is an ongoing art project exploring how generative AI reflects and distorts cultural representation. Its name speaks to its core ambition: to bear witness to the slow erosion of Western cultural hegemony by exposing the cracks in which other cultures shine through.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will discuss the blurry boundary between legitimate cultural representation and prejudice in AI-generated media and how generative AI can be used as a tool to explore humanity's digital foot print.&#13;
It is permeated by a critique of purely profit-driven AI development and it's tendency to blunt artistic exploration and expression.</abstract>
        <description>Generative AI models ingest huge datasets gathered all over the web. Unsurprisingly, they reflect decades of Western cultural hegemony. Yet, the hegemony is not absolute.

Non-Western motifs, that is, recurring patterns and themes with deep cultural resonance, can be discovered and reproduced across different generative AI models.

In this talk I will explain the methods I developed to draw out motifs, the journey I took and what I learned along the way. I will present motifs and use them to outline a space stretching from representation to prejudice on the one hand and western to non-western depiction on the other.

Finally, I will make a case for AI as a tool for cultural exploration and discuss how monetary incentives jeopardise this endeavour, adding to the long list of reasons to break up monopolies with transparent, publicly-funded AI-models.

        <description>The Spectrum is a new queer-feminist, intersectional and transdisciplinary hackspace centering FLINTA+, creatures with disabilities, and other marginalized communities founded in 2025. We see hacking as more than code and machines—it’s a way of exploring the world through curiosity, play, and care. By taking things, systems, and ideas apart, we uncover new perspectives and possibilities for change. Our space is built around awareness, inclusion, and open access to knowledge. We aim to create an environment where everyone can learn, share, and experiment freely—without the constraints of “normality.” From art and music to activism and technology, The Spectrum brings together diverse disciplines and beings to co-create, collaborate, and imagine better futures.

At 39C3, we want to share our experiences of building such a space: how awareness work and accessibility can shape community dynamics, what transdisciplinary hacking can look like, and how centering marginalized perspectives transforms collective creation. Join us to explore what it means to hack not only systems, but also art, expectations, and realities.

        <abstract>Die AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) der DARPA hatte zum Ziel, die Grenzen der autonomen Cybersicherheit zu erweitern: Können AI-Systeme Software-Schwachstellen unabhängig, in Echtzeit und ohne menschliche Hilfe identifizieren, verifizieren und beheben?&#13;
Im Laufe von zwei Jahren entwickelten Teams aus aller Welt „Cyber Reasoning Systems“ (CRS), die in der Lage sind, komplexe Open-Source-Software zu analysieren, Code zu analysieren, reproducer zu generieren, um zu zeigen, dass ein gemeldeter Fehler kein Fehlalarm ist, und schließlich Patches zu synthetisieren.&#13;
Unser Team nahm an dieser Challenge teil und entwickelte von Grund auf ein eigenes CRS. In diesem Vortrag geben wir Einblicke in den Wettbewerb: Wie funktioniert die LLM-gesteuerte Schwachstellenerkennung tatsächlich, welche Designentscheidungen sind wichtig und wie sind die Finalisten-Teams an das Problem herangegangen?</abstract>
        <description>Die AIxCC (DARPA’s AI Cyber Challenge) ist ein zweijähriger Wettbewerb, dessen Ziel es war, die Möglichkeiten der automatisierten Erkennung und Behebung von Sicherheitslücken zu verbessern.
Dabei sollte ein autonomes, in sich geschlossenes System entwickelt werden, das Software analysiert, Schwachstellen erkennt, diese mithilfe von Reproducern nachweist und anschließend sichere Patches erzeugt.

Unser Team hat sich diesem globalen Experiment angeschlossen und ein eigenes Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) von Grund auf neu entwickelt. Dazu haben wir mehrere Agenten entwickelt. Unser System profitierte von der Kombination klassischer Techniken wie Fuzzing mit modernen Large Language Models (LLMs). Die Synergie zwischen diesen Ansätzen erwies sich als leistungsfähiger als jede der beiden Techniken für sich allein, sodass unser CRS Software auf eine Weise untersuchen und patchen konnte, wie es weder Fuzzing noch LLMs allein leisten konnten.

In diesem Vortrag werden wir:
- das Konzept und die Ziele hinter AIxCC erläutern
- durchgehen, wie ein CRS tatsächlich funktioniert und wie wir unseres entwickelt haben
- zeigen, wie LLMs traditionelle Fuzzing- und Analyse-Techniken unterstützen können
- Beobachtungen zu den Strategien der Finalisten-Teams teilen

        <description>Die Schauspielerin und Politikerin Anne Helm singt eine Hommage an die Musiker*innen einer Zeit, in der politische
Songs zum Ort der inneren Freiheit wurden. In ihrem Programm spannt sie den Bogen von beschwingten Kabarettsongs der Weimarer Zeit über antifaschistische Widerstandslieder, bis hin zu Hanns Eislers wehmütigen Worten über Exil und Heimweh. Begleitet wird sie dabei von Marcel Weller an der Gitarre. Durch ihre direkte und schlichte Interpretation, schenken die beiden den Liedern eine große Aktualität und Nahbarkeit.

        <description>Späti Punk Karaoke Special mit Der Untergang*

Wir sind der Untergang*.
Wir setzen musikalisch um und teilen, wie wir uns angesichts der aktuellen weltpolitischen und gesellschaftlichen Geschehnisse fühlen.
In einer Zeit zunehmender gesellschaftlicher Polarisierung und weltpolitischen Wahnsinns versteht sich Der Untergang* als künstlerische Stimme des Widerstands gegen faschistische Tendenzen, patriarchalischen Backlash, akzelerationistischen Autoritarismus 
und die Auswüchse eines entfesselten Kapitalismus, der die sozialen
und ökologischen Grundlagen der Menschheit gefährdet.
Unsere elektronischen Kompositionen wie “Adenauer ist ein Bus” und “Nichts als Krach” bilden die Grundlage für deutschsprachige Texte, die sowohl poetisch als auch direkt politische Botschaften transportieren.
Wir sind Julia Wilton (Das Bierbeben, Pop Tarts) und Thies Mynther (Das Bierbeben, Superpunk, Phantom Ghost, Chaos Communication Choir).
Angeschlossene Mitglieder unserer Initiative sind DJ und Producerlegende Tobi Neumann am Modularsvsten und der auch sehr gute Sonawriter und Multi-Instrumentalist Yunus als Bratschist.
Wir haben zwei Songs hier für Euch ins Wiki gestellt.

        <abstract>Schrammelpunk aus Hamburg</abstract>
        <description>InPunkto ist eine vierköpfige Punkband aus Hamburg. Angefangen hat alles vor über zehn Jahren im Proberaum der TUHH als spontane Idee. Nach einigen Wechseln in der Anfangszeit stehen wir seit Jahren in fester Besetzung auf der Bühne. Unsere Songs sind mal ernst, mal humorvoll, aber immer direkt. Wer Perfektion sucht, ist hier falsch, aber Energie und gute Laune bringen wir mit.

        <abstract>Minimal bis Post-Punk Cringe aus dem Bedroom. Endlich mal wieder aus sich heraus- und einander näher kommen. Für die Friends von den Friends mit guten Texten, meistens Punk, manchmal sanft, aber Hauptsache Spaß.</abstract>
        <description>Wir, Jona, Fen und Bille, haben uns im Sommer gefunden und plötzlich ist genug entstanden um die Musik auch teilen zu wollen, weil die Texte von uns handeln und, weil es raus muss in die Welt.

Shy, chaotisch, solidarisch, hypnotisierend, fragend, wütend - Es geht um das Nein-Sagen im Spätkapitalismus, wie man trauert wenn man Gewalt erfahren hat, queer desires und was an Leonard eigentlich so besonders ist. Punk, Spoken Word, noisige Flächen, deutsche und englische Texte.

Setlist:
Nein
Victims
Was ist denn an Leonard so besonders
Baby 
Hairpin Turns

https://soundcloud.com/ninsnberlin</abstract>
        <description>Ninsn has been active in Berlin's club and festival scene for over nine years. She moved to Berlin over 11 years ago and hasn't regretted it for a second. For many years, she has been involved in collectives and Disko Babel e. V. – from event planning and stage construction to DJing, which she has been actively pursuing for six years. Ninsn is a member of jonny knüppel and the Kopfüber Kollektiv.
Musically, she moves between trippy minimal house and rich tech house. In her sets, powerful, deep bass meets a house atmosphere – never below 130 bpm.
In addition, her heart beats for hypnotic techno, garage, breakbeats, hip-hop, ambient, acoustic music and punk rock, among other things. And she actually believes that there is good music to be found in every genre.

        <type>live performance</type>
        <abstract>Denise Frey macht elektroakustische Ambient-Musik – ruhig, vielschichtig, atmosphärisch. Mit Saxophon, MPC, Effektgeräten und einem feinen Gespür für Klang formt sie in ihren Konzerten Klanglandschaften, die einladen zum Loslassen, Lauschen, Entspannen. Ihre Musik entsteht live – improvisiert, organisch, unmittelbar.</abstract>
        <description>Schon als Kind war Musik für sie ein innerer Antrieb. Mit sechs begann sie am Keyboard, mit 13 kam das Saxophon – nur, weil ein Junge, den sie mochte, es spielte und sie genau so cool sein wollte. Sie blieb dabei. Erst wollte sie Schauspielerin werden, doch ein körperliches Handicap hinderte sie am Schauspiel – also studierte sie klassisches Saxophon. Nach Jahrzehnten intensiver Musikerfahrung, fand sie einen Weg zur freien Improvisation, zur elektronischen Musik – und schließlich zu sich selbst.

„Ich habe nichts gefunden, was für mich mehr Sinn ergibt als Musik“, sagt sie. Musik war nie Plan, sondern Notwendigkeit – ein Mittel zur Selbstheilung, zur Verbindung, zum Ausdruck. In der elektronischen Produktion fand sie nicht nur neue Klänge, sondern auch Freiheit: „Ich wollte nie abhängig sein. Schon mit 16 war mir klar: Ich will eine Band sein – alleine.“

Heute steht sie allein auf der Bühne – und füllt den Raum mit Tiefe. Ihre Sets sind verspielt, meditativ, manchmal technoid – immer offen für das Unerwartete. Was zählt, ist die Erfahrung für sie und für ihr Publikum. „Ich habe immer eine gute Zeit, wenn ich spiele. Und ich wünsche mir, dass andere das auch haben – dass sie leichter rausgehen, als sie reingekommen sind.“

Denise Frey steht nicht da, um sich zu inszenieren. Ihre Haltung ist leise, aber klar. Es geht ihr um Echtheit. Um Berührung. Um einen Raum, in dem alles da sein darf. Wer ihre Konzerte besucht, erlebt Musik nicht als Performance, sondern als Einladung.
Neben ihren Solokonzerten spielt sie im ND Duo mit Nico Petry (Drums &amp; Elektronik) und unterrichtet Saxophon, Flöte, Improvisation und Musikproduktion. Ihre Musik ist so vielfältig wie ihr Publikum – und ihr Anliegen immer dasselbe: Verbindung schaffen. Mit sich selbst. Und mit anderen.

        <description>Tinabel (Tina Belmont) is the creator of  "Rhythm Core Alpha 2", a music creation system for the Nintendo DSi and 3DS game consoles which was available in the Nintendo eShop until March 2023.
She will play a blistering set of her own original music and 1980's covers. 
Yes, there are vocals.
These songs are fast songs about dark subjects: burnout, secret shame, alienation, failed friendships, abandonment issues, etc.
You'll dance and then say "Wait... what?!"
While this is electronic, this is a punk show. Expect intensity.

        <abstract>THE SECOND DECADE &#13;
&#13;
Born `78 in Germany Rob StrobE grew up and being influenced with classical music, swing and jazz in his childhood. &#13;
He early discovered the likes of Depeche Mode, Michael Jackson, Kraftwerk and more early electronic music approaches. &#13;
In his late youth/early adult life he frequently travelled to Frankfurt attending nights at the Omen. Those nights and weekends were filled with DJs like Sven Vaeth, Dj Rush, Chris Liebing, G-Man aka Gez Varley, Hardfloor and so many more, celebrating and transporting the spirit of those days! &#13;
After the closing of the Omen in late 1998 he went on to clubs like u60311, Tanzhaus West, MTW and others and eventually started his career as professional (sound) technician and light jockey. &#13;
Around the year 2002 he started music production - mostly for personal fun and recreational purposes - but some records and remixes have been released since then...some of this older work can still be found on his Soundcloud! &#13;
Since then he developed his own company specialized on music studio technology, room acoustic, signal flow schemes and studio furniture. Meanwhile his own studio transformed from a small Home Studio to a „room-in-room“ environment in the Logic Haus - the former home of Harthouse, Eye-Q and Snap! If he had to describe his musical style and give it a name: it would be „DubHouseTechno with a pinch of Detroit" ;) FastFoward: Year 2021 - after a 7 year break of releasing music, Rob StrobE is back with releases on imprints like Lucidflow, ASrecords, Tantara, Motech and numerous others! Rob used the time to do a major swap from software based production over to the modular and hardware world and the output speaks for itself! Enjoy his music and come pass for a visit on his social media outlets and say „hello“! &#13;

        <abstract>Techno. Live. Modular.</abstract>
        <description>For more than three decades, Arno has been a defining force in the electronic music scene — a producer, sound designer, and passionate explorer of analog sound.
After numerous successful collaborations with a wide range of artists, Mueller emerged in 2017 under his pseudonym Jan Dalvík, stepping into the spotlight as a solo artist.
Renowned for his distinctive analog sound design, Dalvík’s music stands out through groovy, hypnotic, and impulsive beats that bridge the gap between emotion and energy. As a DJ, live act, and producer, he seamlessly moves across a broad spectrum of electronic styles — from ambient and downbeat to deep, driving techno.
Whether performing solo or engaging in live modular techno jams with artists such as Daniel Miller (Mute Records) or Tino Machauer (Shockwerk, Klar Audio), Jan Dalvík continues to push the boundaries of electronic expression — always analog, always authentic.

Denn manche mögen's heiß, und manche mögen's nice.......und Shitstormtechno verliert NIE seine hotte credibility!&#13;
Lass dich überraschen! &#13;
N´abend</abstract>
        <description>Gwen Wayne's Shitstormtechno. Das genre hat sie selbst erfunden, cause she can.
Musikalisch schwer einzuordnen, aber ordentlich dampf und bass hat jedes Set.
Zwischen techhouse, UK Garage und Breaks ist für jeden was zum wackeln dabei.
Und zum Schluss kann jeder sagen: 
"In my heart and in the Rest of my Brain, there will be always a Part of Gwen Wayne".

        <abstract>Zwischen Rap, Tanz und Poesie, erschließt Der feine Schliv neue Räume. In ihren Performances changiert sie zwischen provokanten Auf-die-Fresse-Ansagen an das Patriarchat und empathischen Erzählungen vom Versuchen und Scheitern. Sie tritt unter anderem mit dem serbischen Nachwuchs Duo “Slezga” sowie mit den Hamburger Gruppen “Fallbeil” und “Yummy Air”auf. An der Diverstität ihrer Begleitungen zeichnet sich ihr musikalisches Universum ab, von balladigen Conscious Raps, Chansons und Witchy Toasting.</abstract>

        <abstract>Der verlängerte Atem pres. Ghost Processes&#13;
&#13;
Seit 2020 sendet Der verlängerte Atem regelmäßig auf HALLO:Radio und tourt mit Gastauftritten auf Festivals und Veranstaltungen in und um Hamburg. Als offenes Radiolabor zwischen Musik, Redebeiträgen und thematisch passenden Audio-Snippets, verweben die Vinyl-DJs, Künstlerinnen und Radiomacherinnen Fiona Grassl, Jil Lahr und Martin Ramacher analoge Klänge, Stimmen und Gedanken zu thematischen Sendungen.&#13;
&#13;
Für den 39C3 fährt Der Verlängerte Atem das System herunter - und wieder hoch. Und findet dazwischen: Prozesse ohne Besitzer, Threads ohne Aufgaben, Routinen, die längst beendet sein sollten und doch weiterlaufen. Geisterprozesse flüstern im Hintergrund, aktualisieren sich selbst, verlieren den Takt oder schlafen zu tief, um je zurückzukehren. Zwischen knisterndem Vinyl, digitalem Summen, Glitches und verspielten Redebeiträgen entstehen live Sound-Landschaften, in denen nichts ganz verschwindet - und alles wiederkehrt. Spooky.</abstract>

        <abstract>Operating in a mode of Kluster via Pole, Dub Syndicate at Conny Plank's, or even fang-baring flashes of The Bug and Bryn Jones or Peak Oil modernism, the trio approach the project from the more oblique angles of respective projects Datashock, Phantom Horse and Love-Songs, to probe a more soft-centred, dematerialised and heady sound, but also reserve the right to go tuffer, more venomous, when they feel it.</abstract>

She has been part of Berlin’s slow sound since its early waves, shaping downtempo spaces with a calm and steady presence. Her sets drift between pulse and atmosphere, guided by a deep intuition for timing and tone. To hear Nɨxe play is to follow a subtle current. She doesn’t push or perform. She invites, leads, and lets the music do the rest. Her sound has travelled across continents, yet always returns to something essential: classy grooves that breathe, rhythms that open space, and a gentle pull toward introspection. It’s all held together by a distinct sensitivity to mood and movement — one that doesn’t ask for attention, but quietly earns it. Beneath it all, there’s a soft devotion to acid lines and psychedelic textures. Subtle. Never loud. Always felt.

        <description>Zielgruppe:
Embedded Entwickler, Architekten, System-Ingenieure, die sich fragen: "Bringt meine Arbeit der Welt noch etwas, und habe ich morgen noch einen Job?" Besonders für High-End-Entwickler aus Legacy-Branchen (Automotive, Industrie, Luftfahrt).

Format:
Open-Space &amp; Reverse Mentoring Diskussion (45 Minuten): Ein Austausch in zwei Teilen.

Die Große These:
Dein gut bezahlter Legacy-Job ist ein Goldener Käfig, dessen Opportunitätskosten exponentiell steigen. C-Legacy und veraltete Prozesse machen uns zu Low-Hanging-Fruit für die nächste Generation von Code-Copilots und AI-Automatisierung. Wir müssen uns neu positionieren und unsere Skills "AI-Proofen".

Der Austausch:
Dies ist ein Networking-Event für den Ausbruch. Wir suchen den direkten Austausch mit Leuten, die die Migration bereits erfolgreich geschafft haben (z. B. von Automotive zu MedTech, Startups, oder Open Source). Wir diskutieren: Welchen Purpose hat unser Wissen in nachhaltigeren Branchen? Welche Skills (abseits von C95) sind jetzt gefragt?

Call to Action:
Komm, teile deinen Schmerz und triff diejenigen, die ihren Karriere-Reset-Knopf schon gedrückt haben.

        <description>We will provide information about the EU regulation on the European Health Data Space (EHDS). The key provisions will come into force in 2027 and will then apply directly within all EU countries. EHDS says that all citizens will receive an electronic health record, which will be available EU-wide. Separately, all prescription data for medications will be available EU-wide. Access to pseudonymized health data will be permitted for very broadly defined research purposes. Individuals will have several opt-out possibilities available. How is civil society reacting?

        <description>Most IT systems fail not because someone makes a mistake.
They fail because no one understands the overall behavior.

This SOS deals with emergent system effects:
situations in which correctly built components together produce something
that no one planned, modeled, or controlled.

Using real-world examples from IT infrastructure, cloud dependencies, API designs, AI usage, update cascades, and financial and identity systems, we show
how technical decisions can create lasting stress and conflict – often without a classic attacker, without an exploit, without a clear trigger.

In line with the 39C3 motto “Power Cycles – Rethink, Reboot, Restart,” the session asks the question:

What do we need to rethink before we restart?
What can be rebooted – and what needs a fundamental rethink?

The term “sustainable war” is understood not in a military sense, but in a systemic sense:
- as a state of permanent repurposing,
- overstretching, and creeping destabilization of IT systems,
  which
- drives innovation,
- undermines resilience,
- and generates social side effects.

Especially in times of global upheaval – geopolitical, technological, social –
autonomy, dependencies, and resilience must be reevaluated.
Not as buzzwords, but as concrete system properties.

The session is aimed at:
- Administrators, security engineers, CISOs
- Architects, technical decision-makers
- People from think tanks, regulation, and technology impact assessment

        <description>There is a virtual world that we visit every day. It has billions of inhabitants and billions of places. But, whenever we go, there is nobody. Just the messages they left. We read our daily online newspapers while many are doing the same. We are browsing the same content - but we are still alone. If only we could see the other people browsing the same content at the same time. They might be interested in the same things right now.

Imagine the real world without all the people on the streets. Streets and places, shops, cafés, libraries, deFV
void of people. That's the Internet, the Web as it currently exists. Always has been like that and we got used to it. But we wanted more. We wanted social interactions. We got Social Networks and they turned into meme feeds and brain rot. That's not what we asked for.

We asked for people, real people. And they are already there. What if we  make them visible to each other? Then, ad-hoc communities can form directly at the content. Communities of like-minded people, interested in the same things.

All we need is a federated social layer that cannot be owned, because it is decentralized as the Web itself. An infrastructure of some existing chat protocol in the spirit of the Fediverse or XMPP.

A new way to communicate everywhere, not just in Social Media silos, not after giving up your profile. We want to talk to the people we meet wherever we go. We want to reclaim the Web.

Here is how we do it

Creating a decentralized social layer independent of Social Media silos.

        <description>Abstract: Relationship Anarchy is a guiding principle that hold the promise for us to prefigure the future. This session will start off by defining Relationship Anarchy. It will then nest this definition in the context of our current situation (socially, politically, technologically). Finally, we will look at technologies in a wider sense and investigate whether they are nurturing or hostile towards the prefiguration of Relationship Anarchy.

Description: Relationship Anarchy is a form of livable anarchy. It follows in the steps of anarchy, in that it rejects illegitimate authority and nurtures personal and collective autonomy and agency. Livable anarchy opens up the public space for folx to participate actively in shaping how they wish to live and self-represent their desire and identity. It is rooted in solidarity and a respectful attitude towards otherness.

In this talk, we explore the ways in which technology shapes our ability to practice Relationship Anarchy, as a form of livable anarchy. We start off by acknowledging that our use of technology shapes what we can do, perceive and imagine. In this sense, we can categorize technologies, in a broad sense, as either hostile towards Relationship Anarchy, or as nurturing towards it.

The basis of this discussion is going to be a definition of Relationship Anarchy that catileptic, the speaker, offers in their writing: "Relationship Anarchy is honoring alterity while making one's self subject to others".

This presentation is loosely based on this essay: https://catileptic.tech/posts/relationship-anarchy-technology/ .

        <description>_Introduction to Embedded Rust on Microcontrollers and the [Hakkaa workshop task](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/project/detail/assembly/hakkaa-board-smd-soldering-embedded-rust-for-begin/). This introduction is mostly aimed at beginner participants._

We'd like to give you an introduction to Rust on a microcontroller based on [Rust programming language: An absolute beginner workshop with intro presentation](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/rust-programming-language-an-absolute-beginner-wor). It aims to show you the little differences of this environment, presenting the workshop challenge and pointing you in the right direction for getting started.

This session starts with a presentation of about 30 minutes in English and a round of questions for all. After that, our team supports you with your first self-paced steps.

The initial part of the presentation covers using Rust on a microcontroller in general. The second part focuses on working with the Hakkaa board.

If you've got a question after this session, you can find us at the Hakkaatachi assembly or in [our Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#hakkaatachi-39c3:matrix.org).

We recommend:

* Having a soldered and tested [Hakkaa-Board](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-hardware) (whose kit you can get at the Hakkaatachi assembly)
* Your laptop set up with the [development tooling](https://github.com/hakkaatachi/hakkaa-firmware?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) so that you can spend more time on programming than on installing
* Your laptop fully charged

        <description>(While this abstract is in English, this workshop will be held either in English or German; depending on who wants to participate!)

Programming is not only a useful competency and oftentimes fun, but also a sort of “cultural technique” of our ever-expanding community. This workshop is intended as a first introduction to (Python) programming for absolute beginners. While C3 is traditionally a 'tech/hacker conference', more and more people without a programming background attend – as far as I'm concerned, this is awesome!

While you certainly don't have to be a 'coder' to be a part of Congress (or to be a hacker), programming is still fun, wonderfully creative, and also an extremely valuable skill. Don't be afraid to give it a go!

Of course, by the end of this 90-minute workshop, you will not be a programmer. You will, however, have attempted a deep dive into (Python) programming, learned some basics, and set yourself up for further learning (if you choose to do so). Furthermore, we will explore why it is still worthwhile to learn programming in a world that is seeing increased LLM usage – especially in the domain of software development.

## Target Audience and Required Previous Knowledge

This is NOT a session for experienced developers who want to learn Python. This session is intended for beginners with little to no experience programming! Motivated children and young hackers are more than welcome, but it will be a stretch.

No previous knowledge and/or technical expertise is required!

## Learning Objectives

From a learning perspective, after the session, participants will be able to …

* describe what programming essentially is about.
* name and describe some basic programming terminology.
* define requirements and design simple software.
* model simple problems in terms of data structures and basic algorithms.
* write basic scripts in Python in order to solve specific problems.
* describe the role of LLMs in modern software development.

## About Me

My Name is Ingo, and I am currently responsible for Digital Education and Educational Technology at the University of Cologne. Relevant to this session, I have a background in both education and computational linguistics. My love for Python stems from my work as a (computational) linguist and various projects I've been involved with. :)

## Format

This session will be a 90-minute “code-along” workshop. We will be looking at some fundamental concepts in theory and, together, write some code.

## Technical Requirements

If you want to participate actively (i.e., code along), you should bring a device that is capable of running a modern browser and has Internet access. Being able to type comfortably is also recommended ;). Alternatively, any device capable of running Python 3.10+ (ideally in a Jupyter Notebook) will do just fine!

## Material

After the session, I will provide all materials, including some selected additional resources. All materials will also be provided via this page.

Ps. This is a slightly updated version of the workshop(s) I gave at previous iterations of congress.

        <description>Es geht um große Dinge: Dyson-Sphären und Imperien mit unzähligen Planeten. Wer ist mächtiger? die Föderation der Planeten, das Galaktische Imperium oder ein einzelnes voll ausgebautes Sonnensystem? Anfangs gibt es Raumstationen wie die ISS, dann rotierende Raumkolonien, irgendwann einen Ring um die Erde. Und eine Ringwelt um die Sonne ist erst der Anfang, wenn man eine Dyson-Sphäre bauen will.

Der mögliche Weg von rotierenden Zylindern zur Kardashev II Zivilisation mit einer ganzen Sonne als Fusionsreaktor. Wie man das baut, was das dann bedeutet und ob man sowas überhaupt braucht. Spoiler: Dyson-Sphären werden unterschätzt. Sie sind größer als man denkt und vieles ist ganz anders, als man aus Science Fiction kennt. Eigentlich können wir mit heutiger Technologie schon einen Dyson-Schwarm bauen. Wir haben sogar schon angefangen. Es ist nur verdammt viel Arbeit für die Bots. Aber dann gibt es fast unendlich viel Lebensraum und noch mehr Compute-Leistung.

        <description>‘New smoke detectors spy on tenants – and they have to pay for it’ was the headline in Stern magazine on 5 November 2024. The ‘smart’ smoke detectors referred to in the article have sensors that can detect fires and also measure ‘personal climate data’, transmitting it wirelessly [2, 3]. Consumer advocates have warned of infringements on personal rights [4, 5], and the topic has also sparked heated discussions within the community [6]. However, Techem claims that neither landlords nor they can determine which rooms someone is currently in. It is also not possible to track whether people are leaving the apartment or coming home” [3]. [3].

Workshop schedule:
In about 10 to 15 minutes, we will introduce the topic of simple sensor data in the smart home. We will present examples of simple sensors from our research and explain how they were created using our sensor kit [7–9].


The second part is a joint 'data guessing game'. We will examine selected data traces that could have been generated by smart smoke detectors, such as the 'Multisensor Plus', and similar devices*, and attempt to collectively analyse the data and classify it.

The final 20–25 minutes of the workshop will be reserved for reflection.
How meaningful is simple sensor data from the home?
What impact can this sensor data have on privacy?
How should we deal with it?

        <description>In February 2024, a pilot project was launched in Hamburg to issue payment cards to refugees. Individual municipalities in Bavaria, Thuringia and Brandenburg followed suit, and now the cards are in use throughout Germany. Not much has changed: with the prepaid debit card, most places still do not allow more than €50 per person per month to be withdrawn in cash. This often incurs fees or there are minimum purchase values of €5-10. Transfers and direct debits are only possible to approved payees. Contrary to promises, online shopping is often not possible or only possible with special permission from the authorities.
This is discriminatory, degrading, stigmatising and prevents self-determined living!

We have therefore organised ourselves and founded initiatives. In March 2024, the initiative ‘No to payment cards in Hamburg’ launched a voucher exchange programme in solidarity with other people opposed to payment cards. Other cities and initiatives soon followed, such as ‘Offen! München’, ‘Konten statt Karten’ Leipzig and ‘No to payment cards Berlin-Brandenburg’. We are now networked with many other initiatives across the country that oppose payment cards. We inform, protest, exchange ideas and not at least vouchers in solidarity to support people with payment cards and help them obtain more cash. 
We want to continue to reach as many people as possible and encourage them to get involved, exchange ideas, build their own structures and join us in protesting against the payment card. In Hamburg, the issuance of the payment card has already been extended to other groups of people and ‘tested’ for further escalation levels. They mean all of us!
Discrimination and disenfranchisement through payment cards and similar dirty tricks are nothing new. Whether it was chip card systems in the 1990s and 2000s or the issuance of benefits in the form of vouchers – we've seen it all before. But what we also saw was resistance, bartering and solidarity shopping campaigns!  As a result, local and state governments had to scale back their system of control. And even if they are now ramping them up again at full speed, we can do the same with our resistance!
So let's stop the payment card and stand together against racist policies and the dismantling of social rights!

        <description>Talk with ABC Belarus

It’s been 5 years since people in Belarus rose up against dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko and for months tried to get rid of authoritarian regime through peaceful demonstrations, direct actions, strikes and acts of sabotage. The world has changed radically since that uprising with situation in Belarus becoming even more precarious since russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine.

At this anniversary we are going to look into the past, talk about the reality of resistance against russian empire and what were the chances of success for people in Belarus in 2020 knowing all the plans of Putin at this point of history.

The presentation expects you to have basic knowledge of political situation in Belarus/Russia/Ukraine.

        <description>Society is not built for neurodivergent minds. Discrimination, exclusion, and institutional bullying are not individual misfortunes; they are systemic failures. I will share insights from my own journey and the practical tools I’ve developed to fight back against these structures.

But individual resilience isn't enough. We are using this session at 39C3 to found a community that refuses to accept institutional discrimination. Our goal is to organize peer support, expose systemic abuse, and build a solid infrastructure for mutual aid.

This is not a lecture. Together, we will define how this collective will operate. Bring your anger, your ideas, and your skills. Let’s hack the structures that try to shut us out.

        <description>The ‘Digital Omnibus’ is a collection of proposals from the EU Commission to deregulate existing digital laws, which are actually there to protect people. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the AI Regulation (AI Act) will be watered down under the pretext of supposed reduction of bureaucracy .

Instead of helping ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ or start-ups in Europe, as promised, it is primarily US big tech giants that would benefit, and the European Commission's proposals read like an implementation of the Trump administration's wish list.

The session is intended to be a networking meeting for civil society NGOs and individuals to stop the omnibus bill.

This session follows a talk on the topic on Day 1, which we therefore recommend:

        <description>**Meet &amp; Eat: Come to the Vegan Chaos Bring-Along Fingerfood Brunch! Bring whatever you like, sweet or savoury, anything goes as long as it's vegan!**

The great thing about this principle: It will scale. If everyone brings something, there is always enough – no matter how many people will be there.

Due to the special congress situation, finger food is best suited for this get-together. If you have access to a kitchen, feel free to prepare something! If not: go to the supermarket, see what's available, and improvise. To be prepared for anything, bring your own cups, dishes &amp; forks if you need them.

At this meetup you will have the opportunity to meet team members from the following funds:

The Prototype Fund supports software developers, designers and other creatives in transforming their ideas from a concept into a software prototype. Together we explore and test new ways for technical and social innovations as open source software from society and for society.

NLnet foundation (after its historical contribution to the early internet in Europe) has been financially supporting organizations and people that contribute to an open information society since 1997. It funds those with ideas to fix the internet. The procedure is fast, competitive and open to anyone.

The Sovereign Tech Agency supports the development, improvement and maintenance of open digital infrastructure. Our goal is to sustainably strengthen the open source ecosystem. We focus on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code.

        <description>Abstract: The world café creates a space for exchanging stories and insights about ethical non-monogamy (ENM) through rotating small-group conversations. Departing from the experiences of everyone in the room, we'll explore the realities of ENM life, learn from each other's stories and questions and decode relationship patterns. The café is primarily for those practicing ENM, regardless: those who are curious/exploring are equally welcome.

        <description>_This is the workshop for the [WissKomm Wiki Talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/digitale-infrastruktur-fur-videos-und-podcasts). Listening to the talk is helpful, but not necessary. You can also listen to the [GPN23 Talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn23-299-ctrl-f-for-facts-mit-dem-wisskomm-wiki-filterblasen-erkennen-und-fakten-sichtbar-machen) or just drop by - we look forward to seeing you :)_

“[Who's speaking?](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn23-213-lanzmining-wer-spricht-denn-da-),” asked arrrrrmin at GPN23. But finding out who speaks how often on talk shows, etc., takes weeks.

But why has no one structured this flood of videos and podcasts yet? Especially now that AI slop is permeating all media, it's becoming increasingly difficult to figure out what's behind what you're hearing.

If you, like arrrrrmin, are looking for answers, the WissKomm Wiki is for you. The project has been in planning since 2021 and will officially launch in 2026 to make videos and podcasts more accessible and understandable for everyone in many workshops like this one. If you want to know more about videos and podcasts, check out the [video at C3PB](https://c3pb.de/blog/vorstellung-der-idee-des-wisskomm-wikis.html), take a look at the [project website](https://borgnetzwerk.org/wisskomm-wiki-2026), but most importantly:

Come by the 39C3 workshop :)

We look forward to seeing you!

        <description>A rope jam is an open, unstructured space to practice, explore, and share rope skills together.

You can arrive alone, with a partner, or in a small group. You are welcome to tie, be tied, switch roles, self-tie, observe, or simply quietly talk rope.

We will start with a short introduction and matching game to help connect people who arrive on time. Late arrivals will not be admitted. You may also bring your own partner or choose to observe only.

This is a non-sexual space. Sensual, rope-focused play is permitted. Wear what you want. A minimum level of coverage is required at all times, as would be expected in a gym. The event is open to participants aged 18 and over.

What to bring
* Non-stretch rope if you have it
* A blanket or cushions for sitting on the floor
* Comfortable clothing. Avoid loose layers if possible
* A small amount of practice rope will be available.

Rules
* Consent is mandatory. Always ask first.
* Respect boundaries, focus, and personal space.
* Do not interrupt active scenes.
* Keep conversation low and rope-focused.
* No photography unless everyone involved agrees.

Whether you are new to rope or have years of experience, this is a relaxed space to learn, practice, and connect. Come say hi, we do not bite unless asked.

Location and time may still change.
Places are limited by room size. You will need a ticket per person.

        <description>Hi 39c3, The Chaos Communication Choir is back! After a three-year break, this time we’ve got a new piece about a special bus called Adenauer, plus the classic Heaven can’t wait, which started it all back in 2017. You can find sheet music and practice tracks here:
https://www.ccchoir.de
For more info on the choir’s history and what we’ve been up to, check this out:

        <description>What happens when players rewrite the rules of economic simulation games instead of obeying them? By hacking classics like Hammurabi, Oregon Trail, and Lemonade Stand, this talk explores how code, ideology, and play form power cycles—and how breaking them turns market logic into creative resistance.

hands-on session afterwards (from 6pm):
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/power-play-cycles-hands-on

–

Economic power hides in rules. Early home-computer “market simulators” such as Hammurabi, Oregon Trail, and Lemonade Stand encoded entire ideologies of productivity, scarcity, and profit into a few dozen lines of BASIC. They taught us how to play the economy — literally.

But what happens when players stop following those rules and begin to rewrite them? This talk explores the power cycles inside these classic games: loops of control between player, program, and system. By modifying code, exploiting glitches, and bending rule sets, we can expose how computational models reproduce economic dogmas—and how small hacks can turn libertarian fantasies into playful counter-economies.

Through live demonstrations and short historical dives, we’ll trace how the simple act of “cheating” becomes a tool of critique. Each intervention reveals a new feedback loop between code and ideology: where every CPU cycle becomes a site of political power.

Can a hacked simulation still be fun? Can rewriting a game’s rules help us imagine different systems of value and exchange? Between nostalgia, code archaeology, and playful subversion, this session invites you to rethink what—and who—games simulate when we let the power cycle run differently.

        <description>A short sneak peek course to the International language Esperanto.

Esperanto is a planned language, initiated more than 130 years ago by Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof. Nowadays it is spoken by more than 100 000 people worldwide.

We are people who for many years have been speaking Esperanto in our every day life. Its the language of our global circle of friends. As there are quite some parallelisms between the worldwide Esperanto community and the worldwide hacker scene, usually there are some Esperanto speakers attending the big Chaos events.

Of course we cannot give a comprehensive course about Esperanto, but a few insights to the language and its community first hand.

The slides are available here: https://c3esperanto.github.io/kurseto/

        <description>"Welcome to the catacombs of Dammtor, the grandest and one of the most ancient in Hamburg. For those of you who have booked in advance please step inside. I trust you have all signed the waiver as instructed? Good. This visit will be of a long duration. Now, please hand over your tickets...”

I will read to you a short horror story in which you follow a guide deep down into the intricate catacombs of Dammtor below CCH, visit the ancient sacred grounds built over centuries - and learn about a ritual only available to the most privileged...

This is not a graphic or scary story but more of a cozy "Gruselgeschichte", which I think will fit very nicely in the late hours after the talks.

"A Visit to the Catacombs of Dammtor" is based on the original work "A Visit to the Catacombs of Via Altamonvecchi" by J. Weintraub, originally published in Karamu (vol. xx, no. 2, Spring 2007), a literary review out of Eastern Illinois University. Performed with express permission by the author.

        <description>Die deutsche Bundesregierung plant aktuell die Reform des Nachrichtendienstrechts. Was bei der medialen Aufregung oft unerwähnt bleibt: Die neuen Regelungen spielen mit Feuer mit Leib und Leben höchstgefährdeter Personen.

Das Problem: Ein ex post Rechtsschutz kommt meistens zu spät, nachdem der gravierende Schaden bereits eingetreten ist. Das bedeutet, der Schadensfall muss bereits ex ante durch präventive Schutzkonzepte und Handlungsvorschläge möglichst verhindert werden.

In einer Austauschsession soll besprochen werden, wie mögliche Handlungsvorschläge, Standards und policy-Entwürfe für ex ante Schutzkonzepte und möglichst effizienten Rechtsschutz im Eilfall entwickelt und verbreitet werden können. Zielgruppe sind nicht nur Jurist:innen, sondern insbesondere auch gefährdete Personen und solche, die mit ihnen zusammenarbeiten (insb. Journalist:innen, Anwält:innen, etc).

Die Organisationskreatur ist Jurastudi in Examensvorbereitung.

        <description>In 1889, peace activist and pioneer of international peace work Berta von Suttner published the novel ‘Lay Down Your Arms' in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In 1929, Erich Maria Remarque published his work ‘All Quiet on the Western Front' in Germany during the Weimar Republic. Both remain important works of anti-war literature to this day.

In 1942, Isaac Asimov wrote in ‘Runaround’ in the fictional handbook for robotics:

"1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law."

Are you familiar with any of these works? All of them? Others? What aspects of them are still relevant today? What can contemporary peace activism learn from them? Where is an update needed? What does peace activism look like when it incorporates modern machines, AI and the digital sphere? What works and initiatives do you know of that emerged after the Second World War and have had an impact on you?

In this session, I would like to invite you to join me in thinking about how we can stand up for peaceful conflict resolution and work for peace in our various professional disciplines and spheres of life in 2026+ in the face of ongoing warmongering and armament.

What does your current peace practice look like? What examples of successful peace initiatives or anti-war art do you know? What is the current state of the transnational (and digitally connected) peace movement? And: How do we protect ourselves and others from repression and attacks by divisive forces and warmongers?

For several years now, I have been working intensively on the topic of peace and have designed a seminar on this topic this summer, from which I am happy to contribute preliminary work and insights to this session, if you are interested: https://www.udk-berlin.de/studium/studium-generale/lehrveranstaltungen-des-studium-generale/archiv-der-lehrveranstaltungen-des-studium-generale/archiv-sommersemester-2025/seminare-kulturwissenschaft-sose-2025/ peace-art-and-you-on-the-aesthetics-didactics-and-pedagogy-of-cultures-of-peace/

        <description>In Leipzig, the initiative Nein zur Bezahlkarte (“No to the Payment Card”) has been organizing a solidarity-based voucher exchange for over a year to circumvent the harassment and discrimination of asylum seekers caused by the payment card system. The voucher exchange has now reached a scale that presents us with organizational challenges:
1.  To organize the exchange as coordinately as possible—and thus as fairly and stress-free as possible for everyone interested in exchanging—we work with a registration system. This requires a great deal of communication, which currently takes place via WhatsApp. As demand and thus the number of requests continue to grow, the communication effort can hardly be managed in this way any longer.
2.  We constantly need more money to meet the growing demand. This leads to an ever-increasing cash reserve that must be managed by the initiative. We therefore want to decentralize our offering—and with it the cash reserve—and empower more small groups and initiatives to create decentralized exchange offers that are nevertheless coordinated with each other.
    To this end, we have developed an app idea intended to serve as a platform where exchange offers created in a decentralized manner can be posted, and which people with payment cards who want to exchange vouchers for cash can access in a low-hierarchy way to search for an exchange offer. The app is intended to be available nationwide for the dozens of exchange initiatives. In this way, it aims to help ensure that the voucher exchange—emerging in many places from spontaneous solidarity-based practice—can remain possible in the long term, as long as the discriminatory practice of payment cards is not abolished by federal legislation.
    We have developed a basic structure for the app, which is to be implemented by two developers next year. At the SoS, we would like to invite people to a hackspace in order to present the development of the app and reach out to more people with coding skills, and to motivate them to support the work.

        <description>How do you manage security in small software engineering teams or startups (2-50 people)?
What did you implement? Which changes did you implement or push for as a security person?

I previously worked at a small NGO and startup and want to create a space to share experiences.

Initially, I'll give some insights about what I implemented in the past year, however the goal is to have a discussion.

Topics might include:
- Fuzzing
- Responsible disclosure (both incoming and outgoing)
- DefectDojo, Dependabot and SecObserve
- GitHub's security features
- Static analyzers ranging from Semgrep to Zizmor

        <description>AI is moving from the Cloud to the Edge. Seeing the impossibility of scaling transformers on GPU clusters and the wild amount of cash flowing to anything that can be called AI. Now using a variety of specialised and exotic hardware companies are applying AI at our doorsteps, telephone masts, street lights.

Companies like Flock Safety apply AI at the edge in their cameras they claim for efficiency and privacy. Yet, they now fail on both counts.

Now that AI is breaking out of the climate controlled data centres. Will it become more smash-able, controllable? Can we prefigure convivial visions of AI? Or, will we see the next round of datafication of the enclosure? What is the Internet of Battlefield Things and how can we fight it?

I plan to show some Edge-AI boards and applications. And hope for some help in attempting to find out its limits and vulnerabilities.

        <description>The Euclidean Sequencer is a hardware gadget developed by students from Cologne. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, thereby creating a sequence. The sequence can be modified using two potentiometers and can be connected to another sequencer or external devices, such as speakers.

        <description>CN: oppression, violance, repression

“Since the early 2000s, I've been investigating oppressive security and surveillance systems oppressive security and surveillance systems while actively engaging with activism and political while actively engaging with activism and political
movements. Because of this, I've been put on movements. Because of this, I've been put on a watch-list by the French government’s government’s intelligence services.

I believe that we need to better understand, to understand the control and crushing power forced upon us, the people, by the war machine. My determination to people, by the war machine. My determination to fight against these powers led me to go and fight against these powers led me to go and investigate the problem at the heart of the French investigate the problem at the heart of the French
war machine – Milipol – the world's leading trade war machine – Milipol – the world's leading trade fair for internal state security.

Follow me behind the scenes of this global business. Together, we'll investigate the making of business. Together, we'll investigate the making of wars, the globalization of surveillance and the wars, the globalization of surveillance and the
business of repression.

The aim of this investigation is to shed light on the inner workings of a system by letting its main inner workings of a system by letting its main players tell their own stories, face-to-face with the players tell their own stories, face-to-face with the camera. We will reflect on our findings with camera. We will reflect on our findings with the help of those who suffer at the hands of the military industrial complex on a daily basis and military industrial complex on a daily basis and who are constantly fighting it in order to exist.

Throughout our investigation, we question our participation in systems and the order of things in the world. Similarly, we question our ability to the world. Similarly, we question our ability to preserve and transform ourselves. 
In the reflection of the war machine, we face ourselves and what we want to become."

        <description>Während es gegen die ersten neuen Polizeigesetze zB in Bayern, NRW und Sachsen um 2018/19 noch große Protestwellen gab, kommt mensch inzwischen kaum hinterher, alle aktuellen Änderungen im Blick zu behalten, nennenswerte öffentlichkeitswirksame Proteste scheint es kaum noch zu geben. So konnte vor wenigen Wochen in Berlin eines der grundrechtseinschränkensten Polizeigesetze beschlossen werden, von dem vorher kaum wer etwas mitbekommen hat. In vielen Bundesländern stehen weitere Verschärfungen bevor. 
Wir wollen hier einen Raum schaffen, um Erfahrungen zu vergangenen Protesten gegen Polizeigesetzänderungen auszutauschen, zu analysieren, welche Strategien (nicht) wirksam waren und warum wir mit dem Protest nicht mehr hinterher kommen, und uns für anstehende Proteste zu vernetzen.

        <description>Instagram, Facebook, TikTok und co sind aus linker und/oder herrschaftskritischer Perspektive hoch problematisch. In a Nutshell lassen sich diese Dienste im Grunde zusammenfassen als digitale Designerdrogen mit einem Algorithmus der auf maximale Suchterzeugung optimiert ist. Im Grunde eines der ethisch fragwürdigsten Produkte die der Kapitalismus des 21. Jahrhunderts zu bieten hat. Dazu zentralisiert in den Händen von den ekelhaftesten der ekelhaften Großkonzerne und mit völlig normalisierter sexistischer und queerfeindlicher Zensur. Hier ließen sich noch eine Million weitere Gründe anführen, warum diese Dienst nicht nur aus linker und herrschaftskritischer Perspektive nicht genutzt werden sollten, sondern eigentlich neben Kohlekraftwerken und Waffenfabriken eines der Hauptziele von unseren Aktionen sein sollten. Aber nein, in den allermeisten linken und anarchistischen Kontexten, wird Instagram und co völlig unkritisch genutzt. Teilweise wird es sogar von Linken aktiv beworben oder es wird vorausgesetzt es zu nutzen um Informationen zu bekommen. What the Fuck?

Wir wollen darüber reden, wie um alles in der Welt es soweit kommen konnte und was wir dagegen tun können.

Please: Das ist kein Ort für die Grundsatzdebatte ob Instagram und co denn "wirklich so schlimm" sind. Wenn ihr so eine Session wollt macht eure eigene. Das hier soll eine Veranstaltung für Menschen sein, die die Kritik teilen und sich darüber austauschen wollen, wie sie in linker Szene Bewusstsein für die Problematik schaffen können. Und: es soll explizit um linkspolitische Kontexte gehen.

Aus linksradikaler Perspektive müsste die Folgefrage sein: "verändert diese Technologie die Gesellschaft zum besseren, zum schlechteren oder ist das offen?" und darauf folgend "Falls zweiteres, was können wir dagegen tun und falls letzteres, wie können wir dagegen Einfluss nehmen?" Aber aktuell stellen sich linkspolitische Kontexte diese Fragen gar nicht. Mit der völligen Akzeptanz von Instagram und co (https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/gesprachsrunde-zum-umgang-linksradikaler-und-anarc) scheinen linke Bewegungen jedoch völlig verlernt zu haben, kritisch über Technologien nachzudenken und zu diskutieren. In großen Teilen linker und anarchistischer Szene, findet zu dem Thema gerade keine Debatte statt, von Aktionen ganz zu schweigen. Vielleicht liegt es an einem Gefühl der Machtlosigkeit, dass man doch sowieso keinen Einfluss auf Entwicklung und Nutzung von Technologien hat? Aber das ist erwiesenermaßen falsch, man muss nur einen Blick auf die Kämpfe gegen Gentechnik, Atomkraft und Kohlekraft werfen. In allen Fällen konnte durch direkte Aktion nennenswert Einfluss genommen werden und zumindest die Dominanz dieser Technologien deutlich eingedämmt werden.

Meine These, die ich als Grundannahme für diesen Workshop voraussetze: Es handelt sich hier um eine Technologie, die die Welt (und insbesondere das Internet) schlechter und nicht besser macht und es ist sinnvoll sie mit allen Mitteln die möglich sind zu bekämpfen. Vielleicht ist sie neben dem Klimawandel die größte Gefahr unserer Zeit. Deshalb wollen wir hier darüber diskutieren, was für Möglichkeiten für den Kampf gegen "KI" wir haben, welche Aktionsformen aus Anti-Gentechnik/Atomkraft/Kohle-Bewegung sich adaptieren lassen und welche nicht und wie wir endlich Bewusstsein in unsere politischen Kontexten dafür schaffen können, dass das fucking wichtig ist.

Und bitte: die Grundannahme will ich in genau diesem Workshop nicht diskutieren. Gerne sonst immer, auch gerne in einer eigenen Session. Aber hier soll es um einen Austausch für Menschen gehen, die diese Grundannahme teilen. Und bitte: Keine Militanzdebatten. Sonst reden wir über nichts anderes. Auch Diversity of Tactics würde ich für die Debatte gerne als gegeben voraussetzen.

        <abstract>Ich bin ja glaube ich reichlich spät, aber da Moepern endlich wieder zum Congress kommt und ich das erst vor kurzem erfahren habe, dachte ich, ich werfe unseren Namen mal in den Hut. Wir sind/waren ein Biologie-Podcast und durch Babypause bei Moepern ist der etwas eingeschlafen. Schaffen wir ein Revival? Verratet ihr's uns. Wir nehmen auch den Podcast-Tisch wenns sonst nicht passt. :)</abstract>
        <description>In der Zellkultur reden Claudia (moepern) und Anna (Adora Belle) über das Leben, die Biologie und den ganzen Rest. Am liebsten schauen wir tief in die Zelle, auf die DNA und schauen Viren bei der Arbeit zu. Wir besprechen aktuelle Themen - aber wollen auch Grundlagenwissen vermitteln. Ihr seid außerdem eingeladen, eure Fragen zu stellen. Ob live oder per Zusendung. :) Und in einer aktuellen Bio-Frage klären wir Biologie-Mythen auf!

Es gibt außerdem einen besonderen Anlass: 23! (Wo kommt das eigentlich her?)</abstract>

        <abstract>Jeder redet darüber wie man eine Krise optimal bearbeitet. Bei Disconnected Unexpected geht es ja darum das das Publikum ein Szenario in den Raum wirft und Teams versuchen eine optimale Lösung zu finden. Bei Och Menno geht es darum das Sachen schief gehen. In der großen Nation Elbonien geht es darum das immer die komplizierteste, gerechtfertigte Lösung findet die garantiert die schlechteste Auswirkungen hat.</abstract>
        <description>Es wird eine Impro Comedy Show, wo das Publikum ein Szenario in den Raum werfen darf, und das Panel versucht die Krise durch wohlgemeinte Ideen schlechter zu machen.

        <abstract>Wie die letzten Jahre gute Tradition geworden ist, blicken Melanie Bartos und Bernd Rupp zurück auf das wissenschaftspodcasts.de-Jahr 2025 und sprechen über die Perspektiven, die sich für das Wissenschaftspodcast-Jahr 2026 abzeichnen.&#13;
Dabei beleuchten wir die Herausforderungen bei der Kuration, die Anmeldezahlen neuer Wissenschaftspodcasts, die Weiterentwicklung der Website sowie den Aufbau und die Betreuung der WissPod-Community. Diese umfasst inzwischen rund 420 Wissenschaftspodcasts mit insgesamt über 33.000 Episoden.  2025 wurde erstmalig ein Podcast-Adventskalender mit 24 kuratierten Spezial-Podcast-Episoden aufgesetzt.&#13;
&#13;
Wie die letzten Jahre reden wir aber auch über ein Thema, das die Wissenschaft aber auch die Wissensvermittlung oder Wissenschaftskommunikation beeinflusst.  Dieses Jahr geht es dabei um KI in der Wissenschaft.  Wir blicken auf Chancen und Risiken: In der individuellen Perspektive der einzelnen Wissenschaftler*innen ergeben sich oft große Möglichkeiten zur Beschleunigung der eigenen Arbeit.  Dabei geht man aber leicht eine Beziehung mit großen Tech-Konzernen mit unklaren Interessen und Zielen ein. Daraus ergibt sich der Bedarf einer Wahrheitsschutz-Gesamtrechnung für eine Wissenschaft in der KI flächendeckend eingesetzt wird.</abstract>
        <description>Mit unseren Gästen sprechen wir über Podcasts in der Wissen{schaft}skommunikation, über Ziele und Kriterien – und darüber wie KI die Wissenschaft verändert.

        <title>Denkangebot: Rainer Mühlhoff über KI und autoritäre Sehnsüchte im Silicon Valley</title>

        <abstract>Der Hype um künstliche Intelligenz ist allgegenwärtig. Selbst Donald Trump postet KI-generierte Videos, in denen er sich wahlweise als Rockstar oder Kampfjetpilot inszeniert. Elon Musk prahlte öffentlich damit, dass in seinem "Department of Goverment Efficiency" der soziale Kahlschlag mit Unterstützung Künstlicher Intelligenz vorangetrieben wird. Und Peter Thiel meint allen ernstes, KI-Regulierung und das Erscheinen des Antichristen gingen Hand in Hand. Müssen wir uns Sorgen machen?</abstract>
        <description>Rainer Mühlhoff ist Professor für Ethik und kritische Theorien der Künstlichen Intelligenz an der Universität Osnabrück. In seinem kürzlich erschienen Buch "Künstliche Intelligenz und der neue Faschismus" setzt er sich kritisch mit dem KI-Hype auseinander. Und er erklärt, welche toxischen Ideologien zentraler Akteure aus dem Silicon Valley Menschen empfänglich für autoritäre Gesellschaftsbilder machen.

Wir sprechen über die Zyklen von KI-Hypes, das problematische Narrativ vom "Bürokratieabbau durch AI" und die Funktion apokalyptischer Zukunftsvisionen. Vor allem aber will ich von Rainer wissen: Welche Bedeutung haben bei dieser Debatte die in Teilen des Silicon Valley einflussreichen ideologischen Strömungen – von radikalem Cyberlibertarismus über Longtermismus bis hin zum "Dark Enlightment"?

        <abstract>Body diversity by default. This workshop is a shared exploration space aiming to perceive body, breath and emotion as a psychological safe space. We explore interoception, adaptive movement and sensing without judgement.</abstract>
        <description>Yoga becomes a tool for systemic change when it centers inclusion, questions appropriation and reshapes community. It is activism expressed through presence. We invite you to a slow, accessible practice designed to build mental strength and reclaim power through embodiment. We adjust poses to fit all needs and focus on a collective experience where everyone feels welcome by establishing inviting language and tools like consent cards, etc.

        <abstract>Write software programs in ChucK that take in laptop input (e.g. keyboard, trackpad, mic) and output sounds of your choosing! No experience required, but some familiarity with programming recommended. Required: macOS/windows/linux laptop and headphones.</abstract>
        <description>This workshop will enable participants to map different types of computer input to different parameters of sound (e.g. pitch, volume, sound effects). The focus here is on creating laptop instruments intended for live performance.

We will use the ChucK programming language to do this. Imagine being able to create a fully-customizable synthesizer that you can run locally on your computer with your laptop keyboard, playing sound effects with a mouse click, or pitch-bending with your trackpad. No experience required, but some familiarity with programming is recommended. Everyone is welcome.

Required: a macOS/windows/linux laptop and headphones, and an external mouse would be a nice-to-have.

        <abstract>What can we learn from ordinary packets on the wire, using a disconcerting IoT toy ordered online as a demo device? How can you tell when something is phoning home? In this workshop, we’ll use Wireshark to observe what devices send and receive during regular operation</abstract>
        <description>Please download and install wireshark and the course material before you arrive!
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
https://codeberg.org/katalyst/39c3-packet-analysis-workshop-material

I will be around for an hour beforehand in the Haecksen Assembly if you need help with installing, but pls have the files downloaded.

This workshop is for the curious!  You don't need to know anything in advance.

As stated in the title, the workshop is FLINTA only,

        <abstract>Habt ihr Fragen an die Haecksen, seit aber keine Haeckse oder könnt sogar keine Haeckse werden?&#13;
Bringt sie mit, wir suchen die Antwort für eure Fragen.</abstract>
        <description>Dieser Workshop ist der Ort um komplizierte Fragen an die Haecksen zu stellen. Wir schauen die Fragen mit euch zusammen an und geben bei Möglichkeit eine Antwort.

Für diese eine Stunde sind 'unbequeme' Fragen ok, unangemessenes Verhalten aber natürlich nicht.

Sind die Haecksen wirklich der größte Chaostreff vom CCC mit ~1000 Mitgliedern?
Was sind die Ziele der Haecksen?
Wie kann man die Haecksen oder generell Gleichberechtigung unterstützen?
Warum können zB. endo cis Männer keine Haecksen werden?
Warum sind dann trotzdem die meisten Workshops der Haecksen für alle Wesen besuchbar?

Diese Runde ist explizit an Menschen gerichtet, die sich nicht in FLINTA* wiederfinden können und damit keine unserer anderen Veranstaltungen besuchen können, in denen wir solche Fragen beantworten.

Kommt gern vorbei, wir antworten vermutlich ;)

        <abstract>Rust programming language: An absolute beginner workshop with intro presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Absolute beginner means “beginner in Rust” just as well as “beginner in programming”. Anyone interested can benefit from the introductory presentation, the exercises and our guidance, regardless of experience.</abstract>
        <description>**A heartfelt welcome!**

We will hold a Rust workshop – FLINTA edition – for beginners.

We will start with an introduction in the form of a lecture of about 45 minutes.

This will be followed by a period of about 75 minutes (including a short break), during which you are going to work through exercises independently and at your own pace.

We will help with any questions. We — and you — will be supported by the automated Rustlings course.

Other experienced Rust developers will be on hand to help participants directly with questions during the workshop.

Don't hold back: You are very welcome to ask questions during the workshop!

**You will need:**

- A laptop, prepared as described below, so we can get started right away.

**Preparation**

- Follow the instructions at **&lt;https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/&gt;** for the installation of Rust itself, as well as the interactive Rustlings course.
- Also note the instructions for the editor and terminal. The integration with [**rust-analyzer**](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) will make your Rust experience much more enjoyable!

**Verify that your setup works ahead of time!**

If you would like to receive help setting this up or verifying that your setup works well (especially if you use Windows), please come by our friendly Rust assembly or contact me directly.

**Power supply**

The workshop rooms at the venue might not be well prepared for work with many laptops: there might not be any power sockets at the tables.

- Please bring your laptop fully charged.
- If you can, then bring a long cable and multi-sockets, so you can provide yourself and others with electricity.

**See you at the workshop — great to have you!**

Es ist an der Zeit dafür zu sorgen, dass wir mehr Engagement bei den Haecksen hinbekommen und das Wissen, wie alles funktioniert, schneller verteilen. Lasst uns die Struktur dezentralisieren und rebooten.</abstract>
        <description>Einzelne Personen tragen viele Hüte. Die gesamte Struktur wird durch wenige am Laufen gehalten. Gerade durch das Wachstum der letzten Jahre und die damit verbundene Größe von ~1000 Haecksen sollte dazu führen, dass die Last verteilt wird – und nicht einfach mehr Aufwand auf weiterhin wenigen Schultern verteilt wird. Die Haecksen sind keine reine remote Gruppe, aber auch keine, die nur offline tätig und sichtbar ist. Damit müssen wir einen guten Umgang finden, damit beide Bereiche gut miteinander funktionieren.

Wir sind viele und unsere Existenz ist wichtig, Es ist an der Zeit die Haecksen neu zu strukturieren; beginnend bei der Kommunikation über die IT hin zu den Ortsgruppen. Sei es nun die Übernahme von mehr Verantwortung durch eine Verteilung der Verantwortung auf die Ortsgruppen oder einen anderen Ansatz. Es gibt einige Themen, die wir einmal bearbeiten müssen, um diese großartige und wichtige Struktur weiter zu verbessern.

Lasst uns in diesem Workshop Verantwortung übernehmen und die bestehenden Strukturprobleme angehen und gemeinsam Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung erarbeiten. Am Anfang soll eine Themensammlung stattfinden, um zu erfassen, was es anzugehen gilt. Danach möchten wir in kleineren Arbeitsgruppen die ersten möglichen Maßnahmen definieren. Alles folgt dem Ziel, die Haecksen wieder voran zu bringen und zu einem Ort des Engagements zu machen – in dem die Verantwortung von vielen getragen wird.

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>Wir zeigen Alltagsbarrieren – und wie ihr helfen könnt, sie mit Open Data abzubauen. Nach einer kurzen Einstimmung zeigen wir, wie aus einzelnen Daten ein Gesamtbild für mehr Teilhabe entsteht und erfassen dann gemeinsam Orte auf dem Gelände.</abstract>
        <description>Komm ich mit einem Rollstuhl in das Café oder hat es Stufen? Wie kriege ich überhaupt mit, wo ich hin muss? Barrieren fallen oft erst auf, wenn man selbst davon betroffen ist - oder aber gelernt hat, auf sie zu achten. Deshalb starten wir mit einer kurzen Sensibilisierungsübung zum Thema Inklusion &amp; Barrierefreiheit (nicht nur fürs Thema Mobilität).

Anschließend zeigen wir euch einen „sozialen Algorithmus“, der Barrierefreiheit auf der Ebene von Stadtverwaltung, Politik und Aktivismus vorantreiben soll. Wir geben Einblick in die Entwicklung unseres Projekts a11y-Score, welches vom Bundesministerium für Verkehr (BMV) im Rahmen der mFund-Initiative gefördert wird.

Weiter geht's mit einer Einführung in die Wheelmap: einer offenen Karte (basierend auf OpenStreetMap), mit der Menschen weltweit Zugänglichkeit dokumentieren können - auch für den vorgestellten Algorithmus.

Nach dem Workshop gehen / rollen wir in Gruppen über das Gelände und probieren das ganze konkret vor Ort aus.

Zum Abschluss bleibt Zeit für Fragen, Austausch und Ideen. Lasst uns gemeinsam die Welt zugänglicher machen - one data entry at a time! ✊

Wheelmap: https://wheelmap.org
a11y-Score: https://a11yscore.org

Falls ihr als Teilnehmer*innen eine Sinneseinschränkung, Behinderung oder ein bestimmtes Bedürfnis habt, lasst uns das gern vorab [per Mail](mailto:info@wheelmap.org) wissen. Wir versuchen dann, gemeinsam dafür zu sorgen, dass alle auf dem gleichen Level mitmachen können.

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>Ich habe keine Lösungen, möchte aber einen Raum für Austausch schaffen.</abstract>
        <description>Diese Austauschrunde ist vielleicht für dich interessant, wenn du dich hierdurch angesprochen fühlst:

- Du willst gern einen neuen Menschen kennenlernen, möchtest aber in deinem Tempo und selbstbestimmt entscheiden, wann du welche Informationen über dich in einem Kennenlernprozess teilst?
- Du möchtest nicht, dass deine Daten kommerziell genutzt werden?
- Aktuell bestehende Dating-Apps fühlen sich für dich nicht nach einem Safe Space an?
- Du möchtest gern die Vorteile von Online-Dating nutzen, z.B. weil du schüchtern bist oder eine Lebenssituation hast, in der du wenig neue Menschen kennenlernen kannst?
- Du möchtest dich mit anderen austauschen und erwartest dabei keine "fertigen Lösungen"?

Die Austauschrunde richtet sich an Personen, die aktuell gern einen neuen Menschen kennenlernen möchten. Es ist aber KEIN SPEED-DATING, sondern es geht um einen inhaltlichen Austausch, z.B. auf persönlicher, gesellschaftlicher, gern auch technischer Ebene.

Die Austauschrunde ist für Menschen ab 18 Jahren, denen ein wertschätzender und rücksichtsvoller Austausch zum Thema wichtig ist.

        <abstract>Ein nerdiges Pub-Quiz -- mit Fragen nach Wissen aus den Bereichen "Allgemein-Wissen", "Pop-Kultur" und "Diversität und Inklusion".</abstract>
        <description>Das Quiz ist offen für alle.
Wir stellen hauptsächlich lustig-interessante Fragen.

Es gibt keine Fragen nach "Nerd-Credibility".
Du kennst keine DIN-Normen? Sammelst und behebst keine Software-Bugs? Um Viren kümmerst du dich mit Desinfektionsmittel? 
Dann bist du bei uns richtig. Wir quizzen uns durch Geographie, Geschichte, Filme und Serien -- immer mit einem Blick auf Diversität und Inklusion.

Wir versuchen, schwierige Themen (z.B. Gewalt, Diskriminierung, etc.) zu vermeiden bzw. sensibel zu behandeln.

Das Typische Pub Quiz eben. Wir stellen Fragen und ihr Schreibt die Antworten auf einen Zettel.&#13;
Das Team mit den meisten richtigen Antworten gewinnt einen kleinen Preis.&#13;
&#13;
Themengebiete alles Rund um Demos, Riots und Linke Kultur.</abstract>
        <description>Bei einem Pub Quiz bildet man ein kleines Team mit einem lustigen Namen. Dann gibt es hintereinander Fragen. Mal sind es Schätzfragen, mal der Name einer Gruppe, der Name eines Liedes oder eine kleine Anekdote zu einem kurzen Videoausschnitt oder Bild. Für die Beantwortung jeder Frage gibt es dann etwa eine Minute Zeit und am Ende muss der Zettel mit den Lösungen abgegeben werden. Diesen kontrollieren wir dann und Küren dann das Team mit dem meisten Riot Wissen.

Ein Spaß für die ganze Bezugsgruppe.

        <abstract>„Water to Voice“ ist ein sich ständig weiterentwickelndes Werk, das aus dem Prozess des Klonens von Lisas Stimme entstanden ist. Der Fluss und die Bewegung des Wassers steuern und lösen die Stimme aus und schaffen so ein einzigartiges Zusammenspiel zwischen den beiden Elementen. Es fängt die Stimme mitten in ihrem Trainingsprozess ein – wie sie sich verändert, stolpert und neu interpretiert. Während sich das Wasser bewegt, formt und unterbricht es den Klang und verwandelt die Bewegung der Flüssigkeit in eine stimmliche Geste. Das Ergebnis ist weder rein menschlich noch rein künstlich, sondern etwas dazwischen – lebendig, instabil und sich ständig verändernd. „Water to Voice“ wird zu einem Dialog zwischen Natur und Technologie, einer fragilen Choreografie, in der die Stimme in Echtzeit lernt, ins Stocken gerät und sich weiterentwickelt.</abstract>
        <description>»Water to Voice« is an evolving piece born from the process of cloning Lisa’s voice. The flow and movement of water control and trigger the voice, creating a unique interplay between the two elements. It captures the voice in the midst of its training—shifting, stumbling, reinterpreting itself. As the water moves, it shapes and disrupts the sound, transforming liquid motion into vocal gesture. What emerges is neither purely human nor purely artificial, but something in between—alive, unstable, and constantly transforming. »Water to Voice« becomes a dialogue between nature and technology, a fragile choreography in which the voice learns, falters, and evolves in real time.

#### Artist Bio:

The duo Lisa L. Zwinzscher &amp; Nina Bendix Igleses (Leipzig/Weimar) explores the boundaries of listening and voice in the digital realm. Emerging from Lisa L. Zwinzscher’s solo project Pony Pracht, which blends music with interactive, game-inspired visuals, her work expands to questions of identity and authenticity in the age of AI. As a singer, she has cloned her own voice, transforming it into a human-artificial live instrument.  Fascinated by the tactile, sonic and metaphorical qualities of water, Nina Bendix Igleses approaches listening as a multisensory practice of relating to the world, investigating interconnection within and between self and environment. Together, they engage with questions of identity, resonance, and transformation, creating sonic environments that explore what it means to be human.

It captures the voice in the midst of its training—shifting, stumbling, reinterpreting itself. As the water moves, it shapes and disrupts the sound, transforming liquid motion into vocal gesture. What emerges is neither purely human nor purely artificial, but something in between—alive, unstable, and constantly transforming. »Water to Voice« becomes a dialogue between nature and technology, a fragile choreography in which the voice learns, falters, and evolves in real time.

#### Artist Bio:

The duo Lisa L. Zwinzscher &amp; Nina Bendix Igleses (Leipzig/Weimar) explores the boundaries of listening and voice in the digital realm. Emerging from Lisa L. Zwinzscher’s solo project Pony Pracht, which blends music with interactive, game-inspired visuals, her work expands to questions of identity and authenticity in the age of AI. As a singer, she has cloned her own voice, transforming it into a human-artificial live instrument.  Fascinated by the tactile, sonic and metaphorical qualities of water, Nina Bendix Igleses approaches listening as a multisensory practice of relating to the world, investigating interconnection within and between self and environment. Together, they engage with questions of identity, resonance, and transformation, creating sonic environments that explore what it means to be human.

        <abstract>Improvisierte elektronische Musik auf einem hybriden Setup, bestehend aus einem kleinen modularen System und digitalen Komponenten, die in Pure Data programmiert sind. Der Fokus liegt auf der musikalischen Erforschung roher elektronischer Klänge ohne den Einsatz von Echo, Hall oder Loopern. Auch wenn es rhythmische Momente geben mag, stehen diese nicht im Mittelpunkt, ebenso wenig wie Harmonie und Melodie – vielmehr sind technische/mathematische Strukturen die Ausgangspunkte. Die ästhetische Anziehungskraft entsteht durch die Akzeptanz des Klangmoments als kognitive Erfahrung und die gemeinsame Wahrnehmung eines Spannungsbogens durch Publikum und Performer*in.</abstract>
        <description>Improvised electronic music on a hybrid setup consisting of a small modular system and digital components programmed in Pure Data. The focus is on the musical exploration of raw electronic sounds without the use of echoes, reverb, or loopers. Even though there may be rhythmic moments, these are not the focus, nor are harmony and melody—rather, technical/mathematical structures are the starting points. The aesthetic appeal arises from the acceptance of the sound moment as a cognitive experience and the shared perception of a tension arc by the audience and performer.

#### Artist Bio:

i am an electronic/experimental musician, composer, improviser, programmer based in leipzig/germany.

after more than 3 decades as a professional musician and instrumental teacher in various styles and on various traditional instruments, i have become a little bored and saturated with it. in addition, i have felt the desire to devote my life to other tasks such as left wing political, activist work and exploring the social space. therefore i have decided to stop making traditional music and to focus musically on improvisation and electronic sound generation.

this allows me to combine some strong interests - for example, exploring sounds, computer programming, electronic tinkering - and use them for my artistic work. i play live with a small modular system as well as with self-developed digital, computer-based instruments and controllers. in addition to ensemble 
improvisation, i am increasingly interested in solo performances. through my long time as a wind instrumentalist i have become accustomed to always using my breath for articulation and dynamic control. 
that's why i usually use a breath controller for my electronic performances.
in this concert i expect to use an eurorack-modular in combination with pure data &amp; supercollider

        <abstract>Personal data leaks can happen to the best of us. A unique development in machine learning gives us the opportunity to catch lapses before they're passed on for the world to see. This talk covers how Occlumask works and its developments so far.</abstract>
        <description>Have you ever mentioned the weather? Maybe offhandedly complained about mosquitoes? Then you may have inadvertently given away crucial bits of who you are and where you are.
Occlumask is a new tool for detecting content-based anonymity leaks like this, utilizing the capabilities of large language models to provide more accurate 'coverage'. Come and learn about the reasoning behind Occlumask's development, and the various considerations that had to be made during its development.

Topics covered in this talk:

* How does this work fill a gap in the broader anonymity tool context of Tor, stylometry, etc?
* Background of content-based data-leak prevention tools.
* What is Occlumask and how does it work?
* Why use an LLM for this?
* Unique challenges faced by using an LLM.

Enter your own text and see if Occlumask can tell whether you're doxing yourself, and suggest what kinds of information Occlumask should be able to detect and notify you of.</abstract>
        <description>Occlumask still has a long development ahead of it, and we want Occlumask to be as comprehensive as possible when it comes to detecting potential content-based data-leaks. In this workshop, we will be demoing a prototype of Occlumask for you to try. Alongside this, we will be asking how you would likely be using Occlumask, and what you think Occlumask should do for you.

Come if you have ideas on:
* What information do you consider important/sensitive?
* What kinds of situations should Occlumask be able to handle?

        <title>SocksTrace: Preventing Proxy Leaks in Your Applications</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <language>en</language>
        <track/>
        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>When building privacy-sensitive applications, we often rely on proxies like Tor to ensure that no direct connections escape the intended anonymity network. However, verifying that every part of an application reliably goes through the proxy is surprisingly difficult. Even a single syscall escaping the proxy path can quietly deanonymize a user.&#13;
&#13;
SocksTrace is a lightweight proxy-leak detection tool that traces network-related syscalls and validates whether they correctly route through the configured proxy.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk, I’ll show how SocksTrace works under the hood, what kinds of leaks it can catch, and why syscall-level inspection is essential for high-assurance privacy tools. I’ll also walk through real-world findings: during our testing, we identified previously unknown proxy leaks in major browsers including Firefox and Brave, one of which resulted in a confirmed bug bounty. These results highlight how subtle proxy routing mistakes can occur even in widely-used, privacy-oriented software.</abstract>
        <description>SocksTrace is a Linux-based proxy leak detector and traffic proxifier built on seccomp-notify. By intercepting network syscalls directly in the kernel, it provides runtime-agnostic visibility and enforcement that works even for statically linked binaries and modern browsers.

The talk showcases real WebRTC-related proxy leaks discovered using SocksTrace, explains shortcomings of traditional tools, and demonstrates transparent SOCKSification, DNS enforcement, and safe handling of applications that launch their own Tor instances. We conclude with practical use cases and future directions for syscall-level network containment.

        <abstract>Quantum computers represent a looming threat to much of the critical foundations of modern cryptography. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) utilizes hard mathematical problems that we believe resist the so-called "quantum advantage," to preserve security and privacy. In this workshop we will unpack the principles behind the leading PQC families such as lattice and code based constructions, then showcase their implications for cryptocurrencies, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge protocols.</abstract>

        <abstract>[be-BOP](https://be-bop.io/) is free and open-source software for **autonomous commerce**. It’s an all-in-one, batteries-included solution built for merchants, not engineers. It lets communities run markets without accounts, tracking, or gatekeepers. From shops to restaurants, ticketing to peer-funding — all self-hosted. Adoption grows among merchants and creators seeking real independence.&#13;

        <description>**be-BOP is free and open-source software for sovereign commerce.**

It’s built on a simple belief: merchants and communities should own the tools they depend on. We design technology that respects privacy, rejects dark patterns, and removes the need for accounts or intermediaries. Our vision is trade without platforms, data brokers, or gatekeepers — commerce as a public good, not a private empire.

Unlike fragmented “self-commerce” tools, **be-BOP is a complete, batteries-included stack**. It supports e-commerce, point-of-sale, restaurant systems, ticketing, peer-funding, and subscriptions — all self-hosted, interoperable, and designed for real-world merchants. It aims for the reliability of a platform, without the capture of one.

Adoption grows from the edges: merchants and cooperatives seeking independence, and creators tired of surrendering revenue to platforms. In **Goma**, communities use be-BOP to organize resources and stabilize local economies under pressure. Elsewhere, artists use it to sustain open culture without permission or lock-in.

The roadmap pushes beyond software. **Multitenant be-BOP** will enable domain-specific ecosystems — tailor-made for farmers’ markets, repair collectives, or independent venues — while **cross be-BOP** will link autonomous nodes into a federation of mutual visibility. Together they answer the twin failures of centralized commerce: loss of agency and isolation.

be-BOP aspires to be more than a toolchain. It’s an experiment in rebuilding economic infrastructure on open terms — a foundation for **free, federated, and sustainable digital economies** that can’t be quietly “enshittified.”

        <abstract>Proprietary tech from corporations and surveillance from governments never been more pervasive and it's becoming impossible to deflect it's patterns of control. Refuse the captured system and opt out into the parallel one, embracing FOSS, decentralization and freedom. Let's explore technologies we can use as an actual tools without serving third parties, building independent community coordination and distributed systems that cannot be controlled. Join us to share your stack and tips on surviving without proprietary technologies, banks and big brothers as an individual and a hackerspace.</abstract>

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>A collaborative dialogue to examine and unsettle the philosophical foundations of decentralization. What do we actually mean when we speak of decentralization, and what forms of order, asymmetry or coordination quietly sustain it? Where does decentralization end and centralization begin, and is this opposition as clear as it appears? Beyond familiar binaries such as order and chaos, what assumptions are embedded in the formal systems, protocols and narratives we rely on? What do participants experience when engaging with institutions, infrastructures or rulesets, and what recedes into the background as those systems operate? Through a self-reflective and performative inquiry, this dialogue explores decentralization not as a moral absolute but as a situated and contested design space shaped as much by what it excludes as by what it enables.</abstract>
        <description>In its iterative, by now familiar format, the workshop opens with a short framing by the facilitator, introducing the inquiry and reflecting on the asymmetry of facilitation itself and its relevance to decentralization. Participants then break into smaller groups to explore the questions raised, with room for divergence, contestation and parallel lines of inquiry. The format remains intentionally open to shifts in attention, authority and coordination as the session unfolds. We reconvene toward the end to share reflections, tensions and unresolved questions rather than to converge on a single conclusion. The workshop invites participants to engage not only with ideas of decentralization but with how those ideas are enacted, sustained or resisted in practice.

        <description>In a world dominated by surveillance and digital control, oral languages are constantly monitored, but sign languages remain largely invisible to automated systems. This session explores the intersection of hacker culture, Deaf culture, and communication, questioning dominant linguistic norms and hearing privilege. Participants will experiment with sign language as a tool for privacy, creativity, and subversion, explore collaborative multilingual communication, and reflect on the politics of visibility and language power. Open to all signers, non-signers, and curious minds ready to hack communication.

Key themes:

Surveillance and privacy

Hacking communication

Sign language as a free / untraceable space

Politics of visibility and language power

Experimentation, creativity, and reinvention of norms

        <description>If the talk introducing celestial navigation inspired you to try taking sights with a sextant and plotting the lines of position on nautical charts, then come to the House of Tea to give it a go.  Bring a pencil, compass and ruler if you have one (we'll have a few to share), but leave your electronic calculator, computer and GPS in the bag since we'll be doing it the traditional way with sliderules, lookup tables and geometry.

        <description>An open discussion on surveillance, tech accountability &amp; resistance:

Across Europe and beyond, governments — backed by private companies — are quietly deploying intrusive spyware and exploiting 0-days to monitor journalists, activists, and entire communities. Most of this happens in the dark, without transparency, oversight, or democratic debate.

This session is an open call to everyone who refuses this model of surveillance: hackers, activists, journalists, researchers, and anyone working to expose abuse and protect the vulnerable. Together, we’ll share findings, map the ecosystem, connect struggles, and imagine practical tools for collective defense — including an open-access ebook and a webinar series for journalists and sources on how to stay safe.

What we want to explore together:

 - Spyware and 0-days currently used in Italy (Paragon)  — and the routes through which they spread
 - Italian-made surveillance tech exported across Europe and the Global South
 - The surveillance industry’s opacity: vendors, brokers, middlemen, secret deals
 - Digital threats faced by journalists, activists, and communities — and how to fight back
 - Opportunities for shared investigations, transnational resistance, and long-term alliances

A new year-long investigation will examine how spyware is deployed against journalists and activists in Italy, how it is used in everyday policing, and how tools like Paragon — as well as Italian-made spyware and 0-days — may be circulating across borders.

        <description>We will be making own Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range devices Z-Wave Open Source SDK an Trident IoT SDK. It will also be possible to do Zigbee devices.

We will program a sensor and a switch using Z-Wave protocol and include it in a Z-Wave network. Or Zigbee.

We will also browse the Z-Wave Open Source project, and how existing Trident IoT and SiLabs code differ from them.

We will also install Linux version of Z-Way - Z-Wave/Zigbee/Matter Smart Home Controller. You will learn basics of Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range, how to include devices and set up security schemes.

We will also master using Z-Way smart home controller, investigate it's API and create own Linux or ESP32-based Z-Wave or Zigbee controller. We will also discuss Z-Wave/Zigbee-to-Matter bridging.

You will need a laptop (Linux, Mac or Windows) with SSH client, USB A, Google Chrome and internet access. Optionally you can use VS Code (install Trident IoT extension).

Bring your Z-Wave devices with you! If you have Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, take it too!

        <abstract>Introduction to Parks on the Air (POTA). POTA is an international radiosport award program that encourages licensed amateur radio operators to visit, enjoy and operate portable equipment in a variety of parks and public lands.</abstract>
        <description>POTA introduction "in a nutshell" followed by joint POTA activation on shortwave in the "Planten un Blomen" park right next to the CCH.

We meet daily at 01:00 p.m. at the Assembly for a short introduction and then go out into the park together. The participants learn how to set up a portable shortwave station and get a crash course in shortwave operation. Then it's time to get on the air! Other radio amateurs around the world are waiting to contact us. Can you manage the 10 radio connections necessary for a successful "activation" of the park?

NOTE: We meet AT THE CHAOSWELLE ASSEMBLY and start there with a short introduction to the POTA program. Then we go out into the park together. Dress warmly and weatherproof! We go outside even when it's raining or snowing!

If anyone wants to join us later: radio amateurs can reach us in the park on 145.500 MHz FM.

Maybe we also put back everything together afterwards and count lost screws.

The fun starts at the beginning, and with the time you will discover a deepness that make it the most complex game existing. In Asia Go it belongs to one of the arts, that an educated person shall know.
We teach the rules in the first 10 minutes and the rest of the time you discover by playing. You can leave earlir or arrive late, but we cannot guarantee you that you get an individual introduction.
And maybe there is even a chance to learn why we think the ear readding move of Shusaku was a real Power Cycle.

        <description>The workshop will be held in German or English depending on the participants.

## Description
This workshop offers a personal look into four years of using Minecraft Education in media literacy classes at primary and secondary schools. Many people only know Minecraft as a game – I aim to show how it can become a practical learning tool that supports creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and digital skills.

The workshop is intended for anyone interested in how Minecraft can be used meaningfully in education or how teaching works inside an open sandbox environment.

## Topics
- Why I use Minecraft as an educational tool
- Concrete experiences from real classrooms
- Setup and technical requirements
- Funding options available to schools
- What Minecraft Education is and how it differs from other versions
- Open Q&amp;A and peer exchange

## Note on proprietary software
Minecraft Education is proprietary and owned by Microsoft. This is a valid point of debate within the Chaos community. I will explain why I chose it for school settings, what alternatives I have considered, and where open solutions currently reach their limits. The goal is a transparent, experience-based discussion rather than product promotion.

**Format:** Short input and open discussion

        <description>Alle reden über KI als Gamechanger, aber wie fühlt es sich an, wenn man als Dev mittendrin steckt? In unserer Session öffnen wir einen Raum, in dem Forschung und Programmierpraxis zusammenkommen. Wir bringen erste Fragen und Muster aus unseren wissenschaftlichen Fallstudien in Softwareunternehmen mit, ihr eure täglichen Erfahrungen aus Projektstress, Legacy Code und Promptbastelei.

Gemeinsam wollen wir rekonstruieren, wie KI konkret in eure Pipelines rutscht, wie ihr mit Black Box Momenten umgeht, warum ihr bestimmten Outputs vertraut und anderen nicht und welche neuen Routinen sich im Team herausbilden. Uns interessiert, was ihr gelernt habt, was ihr bewusst verweigert und wie sich euer Selbstbild als Entwickler:in vielleicht verschoben hat.

Statt Hochglanzversprechen setzen wir auf eine ehrliche, kontroverse Gesprächsrunde. Hier teilen wir Erfahrungen, beleuchten Spannungsfelder und schärfen unser Bild davon, welche konkrete Rolle KI derzeit in der Programmierpraxis spielt, inklusive Widersprüchen. Bringt deshalb gerne die ungelösten Fragen und offenen Baustellen ein, an denen ihr als Entwickler:innen und wir als Forscherinnen gemeinsam weiterdenken und -experimentieren können.

        <abstract>Wie verändert generative KI den Beruf des Programmierens, und was passiert, wenn Entwickler:innen KI-Systeme nicht nur als Werkzeug, sondern als Orientierungssystem, Feedbackgeber oder Management-Ersatz nutzen? Unser Vortrag beleuchtet diese Frage anhand einer sozialwissenschaftlichen Analyse von Reddit-Diskussionen, in denen Softwareentwickler:innen offen über ihre Erfahrungen mit generativer KI im Arbeitsalltag sprechen. Wir zeigen aus unseren Erhebungen: Generative KI wird nicht nur als Code-Assistent, sondern zunehmend als strukturierende Instanz genutzt; eine selbstgewählte Feedbackinstanz, die auf der einen Seite Autonomie verspricht und andererseits zugleich neue Abhängigkeiten schafft. In unserem Workshop  wollen wir gemeinsam darüber sprechen, was diese Gegensätze für uns in der Praxis bedeuten.</abstract>
        <description>Die Softwareentwicklung gilt als Berufsfeld mit hohem Maß an Autonomie, kollaborativem Wissensaustausch und einer stark community-getriebenen Lernkultur. Mit dem Einzug generativer KI verändern sich diese Strukturen grundlegend. Der spontane Austausch unter Kolleg:innen oder auf Foren wie Stack Overflow wird zunehmend durch den Dialog mit dem ChatBot ersetzt. In unserem Vortrag möchten wir die Konsequenzen daraus beleuchten. Zuerst stellen wir drei zentrale Ergebnisse unserer empirischen Forschung vor und werden diese anschließend analysieren und vor dem Hintergrund arbeitssoziologischer Annahmen diskutieren.

Unsere Studie basiert auf einer digital-ethnografischen Analyse von Diskussionsbeiträgen auf Reddit, in denen sich Softwareentwickler:innen offen über ihre Erfahrungen mit generativer KI austauschen. Daraus können wir zeigen, dass Entwickler:innen KI-Systeme in drei Rollen verorten:

KI als Werkzeug:
Die KI wird gezielt eingesetzt, um klar abgegrenzte Aufgaben zu erledigen. Ziel und Vorgehen stehen fest, die Kontrolle über Prozess und Ergebnis liegt vollständig bei dem Nutzenden.


KI als Assistenz:
Die KI unterstützt als dialogisches Gegenüber. Sie kann Ideen liefern und Alternativen vorschlagen, aber Auswahl, Bewertung und Einordnung der Inhalte bleiben beim Menschen.


KI als Proxy-Management:
Die Entwickler:in weist der KI bewusst eine leitende Rolle zu und überträgt ihr die Steuerung und Bewertung des eigenen Arbeitsprozesses.

Gerade in dieser letzten Form zeigt sich ein spannendes Phänomen: KI als Feedbackinstanz ohne soziale Interaktion. Kein Gatekeeping auf Stack Overflow, kein „Wie, das weißt du nicht?“, keine Unsicherheiten vor Kolleg:innen zugeben und keine endlosen Google-Suchen, die ins Leere führen. Stattdessen ein vermeintlich privater und immer verfügbarer SafeSpace, in dem Unwissenheit nicht offenbart oder verurteilt wird – und man immer eine Antwort bekommt. Viele beschreiben das als Gewinn an Autonomie. Andere berichten jedoch vom Gegenteil: Von wachsender Isolation, schleichendem Kompetenzverlust und einer neuen Form von Abhängigkeit.
Diese Ambivalenz verstehen wir als Spannungsfeld zwischen technikvermittelter Selbstermächtigung und Kontrolle. Aus der Perspektive der Professionssoziologie – in Anlehnung an Andrew Abbotts The System of Professions (1988) – werden berufliche Zuständigkeiten („jurisdictions“) stets neu ausgehandelt. Dabei spielen technologische Entwicklungen eine zentrale Rolle, weil sie bestimmen, welches Wissen als Expertise gilt und wer es beanspruchen kann. Für die Zukunft der Softwareentwicklung bedeutet dies vielleicht: Weg vom kollektiven Wissensaustausch hin zu einer individualisierten Praxis.

In unserem Workshop möchten wir mit euch diese Dynamiken zwischen Autonomie und Abhängigkeit hinterfragen und diskutieren. Begegnet uns hier eine neue Form von KI-(Selbst)-Kontrolle, jenseits klassischer Hierarchien? Und welche Folgen bedeutet das für unser Selbstverständnis, Lernprozesse und die soziale Verankerung professioneller Programmierarbeit?

        <abstract>Join this session to gain a deeper understanding of the work of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and how the organisation empowers users to take control of technology. We will explore FSFE’s wide range of activities — from advocacy and policy work at the European level to practical initiatives such as “Public Money? Public Code!”, which promotes publicly funded software being released as Free Software. Explore how we fight for Device Neutrality and how we want to spark children's interest in coding.&#13;
&#13;
The session will also highlight FSFE’s legal support efforts, community-building activities, and public awareness campaigns that help ensure technology remains accessible, transparent, and shaped by its users rather than by restrictive corporate or governmental control.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gemeinsam entwickeln wir genetischen Code. An einem konkreten Beispiel steigt ihr selbst in die Tomatenzucht ein. Inklusive Saatgut.</abstract>
        <description>Du hast zwei Pflanzen gekreuzt. Ihre Nachkommen sind wunderschön. In der nächsten Generation scheint der Zauber kaputt, nur wenige Exemplare besitzen das schöne Merkmal. Was ist passiert? Und wie kann daraus eine stabile, schöne Sorte entstehen?

Vererbung kann stark vereinfacht mit den Mendelschen Regeln erklärt werden, die du wahrscheinlich aus dem Bio-Unterricht kennst. Um Gemüsesorten zu züchten, reichen sie aus:

F1 heißt 1. Kindgeneration. Wenn du zwei samenfeste Sorten gekreuzt hast, mischen die Merkmale der Elternpflanzen sich gleichmäßig. In unserem Beispiel kreuzten sich eine rote und eine gefleckte Tomatensorte zu einer Generation mit rot-violett gestreiften Früchten.

F2 heißt 2. Kindgeneration. Die Merkmale "mendeln sich aus", jede Pflanze wird anders bunte Früchte tragen. Samen von der F2-Generation bekommst du gratis in diesem Workshop.

Züchtung heißt, diese zu selektieren, bis das Streifenmuster nach Jahren samenfest wird. Säe mehrere Körner, ernte viele Tomaten - sammle ausschließlich Saatgut von den Rot-Violetten!

        <abstract>What if local communities operated their own data centres? How might that look and function? To what extent would it be democratic and sustainable? Who would (not) benefit from it?&#13;
&#13;
In this workshop, we would like to think through, examine and discuss alternative models for the ownership and management of collective data centres. We will take a structured look at fundamental concepts, governance issues and implications, as well as discuss parallel ideas in other areas (cooperative banks or housing, community-supported agriculture) in the hope of initiating a broad discussion about alternatives to the profit and exploitation logic of the current data centre industry. Similar approaches to data centers that already exist include Nubo (Belgium), Espora (Mexico) and Wobcom (Germany).</abstract>

        <description>Während die Ökosysteme kollabieren und menschliches Leben auf der Erde immer prekärer wird, lassen sich CEOs großer Tech-Unternehmen zum Spaß ins All schießen und träumen davon, das Universum als unsterbliche Maschinenmenschen zu kolonisieren. Sie inszenieren sich als Heilsbringer und haben für den Rest der Menschheit nur offenen Zynismus übrig. Wir sehen einen massiven Angriff auf Gewerkschaften und demokratische Institutionen, die ihnen bisher zumindest noch mit Schranken drohten. Der Abbau der für ihre Produkte nötigen Rohstoffen verwüstet ganze Landschaften und vertieft koloniale Ausbeutung. Mit ihren „sozialen“ Medien befördern sie die Vereinzelung und den Zusammenbruch von demokratischen Öffentlichkeiten. Sie kontrollieren umfassende Infrastrukturen und setzen diese ein, um die Macht faschistischer Kräfte zu verstärken und einen technokratisch-autoritären Gesellschaftsumbau zu beschleunigen.

        <abstract>As members of the Switzerland Chapter of the Internet Society we would like to bring together activists, NGOs, and businesses who strive to make our communities, states, and supranational institutions truly digitally sovereign, i.e.: As (collaborative but independent) actors connected by distributed networks powered by free software enabling the free exchange of information over open data formats.&#13;
&#13;
Given that those who dislike this vision have deep pockets, excellent contacts to politicians, and marketing teams who try to give "digital sovereignty" a very different meaning from how we understand it ("buy European"), we as a community should&#13;
&#13;
a) network to get to know the other actors who are working on this topic and be more effective **together**,&#13;
b) understand what is going on elsewhere in Europe, and &#13;
c) exchange news, ideas, challenges, successes and failures in influencing policy so that other activists can learn from them.&#13;

        <description>Wir beschäftigen uns damit wie Spiele aufgebaut werden und funktionieren und programmieren ein eigenes Spiel auf Grundlage von einer erweiterbaren und je nach Zeit und Interesse vollständig austauschbaren Jump'n'Run-Vorlage. Wir arbeiten dabei mit der Programmiersprache Python und der dazugehörigen Bibliothek PyGame.

Es ist kein Vorwissen notwendig um die Inhalte zu verstehen; der Workshop ist für alle geeignet die ein Interesse daran haben, zu verstehen wie Videospiele gemacht werden oder eigene Ideen für Spiele umsetzen wollen.

Wer sich ein Laptop für den Workshop ausleihen möchte, sollte sich spätestens eine Stunde vor dem Workshop an der Teckids-Assembly im Digitalcourage-Habitat melden.
Siehe auch [https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/project/detail/assembly/laptop-ausleihe-fur-junghackerinnen/](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/project/detail/assembly/laptop-ausleihe-fur-junghackerinnen/)
Wer ein eigenes Laptop benutzen möchte, benötigt ein Linux-System mit Thonny und Tiled.

Wer nach den ersten 1,5 Stunden noch weiter machen möchte, kann [bei Teil 2 an der Teckids-Assembly]([https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/spieleprogrammieren-mit-pygame-teil-3-tag-2](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/spieleprogrammieren-mit-pygame-teil-3-tag-2)) weitermachen.

&#13;
The 39C3 LED badge contains 42 LEDs that blink under control of of a pre-programmed 4 cent microcontroller. When the badge is alone, the LEDs will blink randomly. When it is among friends (when there are other badges nearby), it will display a chaser pattern. &#13;
&#13;
In this workshop you will learn how to solder Surface Mounted Devices using a normal soldering iron.&#13;
&#13;
Suitable for beginners. Under 16s only with responsible adult supervision.</abstract>
        <description>### 39C3 LED badge -- SMD for Beginners

![39C3 LED badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/b/7dccaedbb7ec/39C3badge.png)

Surface Mounted Devices (SMDs) are small compared to Through Hole (TH) electronic components, and have the reputation of being difficult to work with as a hobyist: Difficult to see and handle, when you sneeze, you loose them and you can not easily use them on 2.54mm raster prototyping boards.

SMD components are designed to be used in a reflow soldering process where tiny dots of solder paste are applied to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), after which the SMD components are "Picked and Placed" on the PCB, after which the whole PCB is heated to the melting point of the solder ("reflowing"), actually completing the  electrical connections.

This workshop is aimed at showing you that the reputation of being difficult to work with is a bit undeserved, and that you can also work with SMDs using just a  regular soldering iron: With some simple tricks and a suitable selection of components (not the smallest possible), the vast majority of people can successfully complete this project.

Being able to solder SMD projects using just a simple soldering iron will also help you develop some skills that are useful if you  need to do "rework" on reflow soldering projects. Reflow soldering is also not difficult to do as a hobbyist, but requires a few more tools like a stencil to apply solder paste and either an oven or a hot plate to do the reflowing. It is, however, much quicker than soldering the parts one by one, and can yield more professional looking, cleaner, solder joints.

The project is an electronic name-badge - You should write your name (or nick) on it and wear it. It contains 42 LEDs, a microcontroller, some support components and an InfraRed transmitter and receiver that allow it to communicate with other badges. When the badge detects the presence of other badges ("friends") nearby, it will change its behaviour. It will not only interact with other 39C3 LED badges, but also with TBD badges - come visit the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp

![TBD badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/e/d619de5f1be1/tbdbadge.png)

### Costs
This workshop is donation based. Materials costs are 2 euro per badge. Donations will go towards 1) covering costs of the badges, 2) covering costs of running the hardware hacking area in general, 3) covering costs of organizing TBD (see the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp)

### Registration
The number of participants per session is limited. First come, first served. Either get a participation voucher beforehand or show up early (there may be places left).
There will be *numbered* paper vouchers available for each session some time in advance of each session. If you get a voucher and do not show up *before* the designated starting time, someone else may take your spot. Please don't take multiple vouchers and don't take  vouchers if you don't actually plan to participate.

### Getting a kit
Kits are part of the workshop and not for sale separately. You can, however easily source your own PCBs and parts and make kits yourself because the design is  MIT licensed open source.

        <description>After three days of conference and talks, what better ways to wind out the day than to get together in a relaxed atmosphere and try to build some hardware?

This workshop is intended for beginners who want to learn how to build their own lora/meshtastic/meshcore/reticulum hardware. These little devices can be used to message each other and build a network utilizing only some small antennas without the need of internet or a phone network. Together, we will build our own solar powered outside LORA nodes that can be used with mesh software such as Meshtastic, Meshcore or Reticulum without the need of a power outlet. We will bring the required parts and an easy to follow "how to" manual. There will be little to no input but we want to create a cozy atmosphere to come together to learn, to solder and teach ourselfs how to create our own communication devices from scratch (well at least almost).

Each node will consist of a solar panel, a low power lora node, batteries, antennas and a few other parts so everything works together nicely.

There will be only a limited amount of seats available. Please come to the hardware hacking area an hour before this workshop starts to get the hardware (35€, cash preferred). This workshop is intended for beginners in Lora hardware and hardware hacking. Some previous soldering experience is helpful but not required.

In this workshop, we will learn to handle the tiniest electronic components, which are used to make modern electronic devices. We will cheat the same way the electronics industry does, and learn the techniques of stencil paste printing and reflow soldering. You will learn a technique that stops your hands from shaking, so you can very very precisely place microscopic parts. We will make an electronic cat that purrs if you handle it correctly. No prior experience or knowledge of anything electronic needed. Caffeine use is not recommended immediately before. All tools are provided.  Takes around 2 hours.

**Materials costs**:  
20€ if you want to make a board, free to observe.

**Taught by** Kliment.

        <description>**Learn to solder** by making a way-cool, powerful music synthesizer, and  
**learn how to make cool music, sound, (and noise!) with computer chips**  
(The fancy word for making sound with a computer chip is *Digital Signal Processing* or *DSP*).

**[ArduTouch](https://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php#ardutouch)** is an open hardware **Ardu**ino-compatible music synthesizer kit with a built-in **Touch** Keyboard, and with built-in speaker/amplifier. It is a really nice performing musical instrument.

This workshop is for **total newbies** to learn to solder.  
This workshop is for **total newbies** to make their own ArduTouch music synthesizer and learn to make music, sound (and noise!) with computer chips. Attendees take their completed synthesizer home at the end of the workshop.

The ArduTouch comes pre-programmed with a way cool synthesizer. And I will show you how to re-program it with other way cool (and totally different) synthesizers, and how to make your own synthesizers.

For ages 10 - 100.

**Materials costs**:  
The workshop is free, but if you would like to partake in the hands-on aspects of the workshop, Mitch will have ArduTouch kits for **€35**.  
*Optional*: USB-Serial Cable for re-programming ArduTouch (and many other projects): **5 €**.

**Taught by** [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman).

_**Optional**:  Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it.  
Arduino software runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux._

**Workshop Itinerary**:
* Intro to music synthesis
* Basics of making sound with computer chips (Digital Signal Processing)
* Basics of using an Arduino
* Learn to solder. Don't let this scare you! I've taught tens of thousands of people to solder, most of whom have never made anything before in their lives. It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful.
* How to re-program your ArduTouch music synthesizer to make lots of cool music, sounds, (and noise!)

**Registration**:   
**Buy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.**

        <abstract>A beginner-friendly, hands-on workshop where you build a working particulate matter air quality sensor using off-the-shelf parts. Learn the basics of IoT environmental monitoring and share your data online with Sensor.Community.</abstract>
        <description># Build Your Own Air Quality Sensor

Air pollution affects many people’s daily lives, not only those living near industrial centres. In Ireland, official air quality monitoring relies on a limited number of sensors, so local and short-term pollution sources can be missed. In this 90-minute, hands-on workshop, you’ll build your own particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality sensor using a kit of off-the-shelf parts, then connect it to the Internet so you can view and share the data.

## Sensor.Community
[Sensor.Community](https://sensor.community/) is an open, global citizen science network where people build low-cost sensors and share environmental data. Once your device is online, it can publish readings so you can track trends over time and compare data across different locations.

## What You’ll Learn
During the workshop, you’ll assemble a working PM2.5 air quality sensor and get it online. We’ll cover the basics of IoT devices, local data collection, and how to publish readings to Sensor.Community. You’ll also learn what the numbers mean, what these sensors are good for, and where their limits are.

## Materials
You’ll work with:
- ESP8266 board
- SDS011 particulate matter sensor (PM2.5 and PM10)
- BME280 sensor (temperature, humidity, air pressure)
- USB cable
- Jumper wires
- Plastic tube (air inlet)

## Requirements
- A device with a web browser and WiFi, such as a phone or laptop
- All setup is browser-based, no software install needed
- No previous experience required, beginner-friendly

## Materials Costs
It costs **€60** for a kit to take home.

## Instructions
Setup steps and links will be shared on the day.

## Facilitator
Taught by [Jeffrey Roe](https://chaos.social/@tdr112).

[To secure spot on the Session 2. (Day 3, MON 20h30) please sign in here.](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheese2_39c3/)

Each cheese tasting session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for this one (like three times overbooked). If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). Still please sign in in advance! FHB will be getting some high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions, each one lasting for about two hours or bit over.

This event is based on donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds.

So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!

        <description>We print with building block tiles, also known as Lego Dots™, on paper.
There will be a short introduction to the printing technique and how to create the printing plates.
We print using the primary colors and can mix any other color as needed.
What makes Lego Dots™ exciting is that you are bound to a grid – in this case, 8×8 units. The tiles come in different shapes: circles, squares, quarter circles, and many more. Have a look at the gallery to see some examples.
We print using a press from the Open Press Project.
The print size is limited to 7×7 cm due to the press we are using.
It is a “jump-in” workshop with no registration required – when one person leaves, the next can join in.

        <description>Universities have become debt traps. Education is no longer about learning—it's financial control dressed up as opportunity. Students graduate with crushing loans. Professors work precarious jobs. Administration consumes budgets that should fund actual learning. Knowledge is sold, credentialed, gatekept.

But what if we could reimagine this completely? Not reform universities—redesign them from scratch.

In this workshop, we're asking CCC participants to collectively design the university of our dreams. Not the university we think is "realistic" or "achievable within current constraints." The university we actually want.

Here are the questions:

Should it be distributed or centralized? Fully virtual or partially offline? How do we use open-source technologies to eliminate bullshit jobs, administration, and bureaucracy? How do we make education free, accessible, and democratic?

Can a university exist without exams, without filtering students, accepting everyone who wants to learn? How do we build around open libraries—like David Graeber's music and book collections at davidgraeber.org—that anyone can modify and contribute to? How does this become not an institution, not a nation-state project, but a community of experimenters distributed globally?

Ultimately, this is about technologies—survival technologies. Social technologies. Poetic technologies.

        <description>Facial recognition systems are rapidly advancing - fusing infrared, facial geometry, gait, and metadata into oppressive infrastructures of racist policing and surveillance capitalism. At the same time, artists, activists and everyday citizens are developing creative ways to interfere, confuse, and disappear from automated identification.

#### Workshop 1: Break Your Face
Hands-on demonstration of Dazzle anti-surveillance makeup techniques. Live-testing our work to understand machine vision -and how to break it.

#### Workshop 2 + 3: Zine-making
Starting with a discussion of creative anti-surveillance tactics, we then combine the workshop participants' knowledge and experience to co-creating a zine.

Info: We will be using easily available live face filters on smart phones (instagram/snapchat/tiktok). Participants can use their own phones. The data is not uploaded or saved anywhere.

        <abstract>Workshop with Debra Guckenheimer</abstract>
        <description>Inspired by Canadian disabled artist Margeaux Feldman, this project is a practice of resisting ableism and other dehumanizing systemic oppressions. Debra Guckenheimer has taken discarded books and created collages to feature as a backdrop to an affirmation. The affirmation is a rejection of an ableist message she received with a disability justice message on the back. She has distributed over 100 postcards around the world to friends and strangers, who keep the postcard up to recite the affirmation as needed. Audience and artist together create change as they practice letting go of harm. This is Debra's first exhibit in Germany, the home of her grandparents until they fled in 1933, as Debra practices healing some of the trauma her ancestors experienced. This workshop is dedicated to the late disability justice Alice Wong and the ancestors of Debra who were murdered by Nazis. Attendees will receive a disability justice postcard (limited quantity available) to practice healing and resistance.

        <description>This is an advanced soldering workshop for creating motorcontrollers that bring motors to tap rhythmically with each other. Each participant builds her own board to drive two motors that will then tap in polyrhythms. The electronic circuits in this workshop derive from minimal and low-cost bio-inspired robots. Oscillators are used to drive motors that produce sound, but they can also be connected to synthesizers. Each circuit board is designed to be wired up with the boards from the other participants in order to explore together the magic of emergent polyrhythm by wiring their individual circuits to form a huge network.
Big fun and deep dive into analog circuits and their emergent properties.

        <description>Stricken ... zwei Nadeln ... das klingt kompliziert. Reduzieren wir ...

Häkeln ... nur eine Nadel ... schon besser ... oder? Wie war das gleich noch mal? Luftmaschen, Kettmaschen, feste Maschen ... doch zu kompliziert?

Ich, elzbeth, bringe Wolle und ein paar Häkelnadeln mit und dann können wir versuchen das Rätsel der Maschen zu lösen und zumindest für den Anfang eine Kette zu produzieren.

Ob ihr bereits Erfahrung habt oder noch nicht, kommt gerne vorbei.

        <description>Eltern können ihre Kinder beim Schwimmenlernen mehr unterstützen als ihnen bewusst ist.
Wir sprechen über ein paar Grundlagen, Ideen und spielerische Möglichkeiten.
Egal ob übermütige oder ängstliche Kinder, mit den eigenen Eltern ist Wassergewöhnung oft leichter.
Gerne werden Fragen beantwortet und Tipps zum Ausprobieren ausgetauscht.

        <description>It is repeatedly becoming public knowledge that the extreme right is also interested in the topic of prepping. However, this is not about a crisis preparedness based on solidarity, but about isolating and protecting their own ethnic families or the German "Volk". Far-right online. shops selling prepping supplies try to disguise themselves as harmless survival shops. We want to discuss how to recognize such shops and what exactly far-right crisis narratives are in an accompanied reading corner. You can take a look at the far-right crisis world through primary sources and ask questions or exchange ideas and experiences.

        <description>Most accidents happen at home — or in your hackspace — and sometimes the most useful methods come from rougher contexts. Many modern emergency techniques were developed for extreme situations, but we’re bringing them back into everyday life. In this mini-workshop, we’ll show you how to stop heavy bleeding with simple tools and why having a combat bandage in your backpack can actually be helpful.

        <abstract>In dieser kleinen Show testet ihr in spielerischen Aufgaben, wie sehr Einsatzkleidung euch ausbremst, schützt oder im Weg steht.</abstract>
        <description>How heavy is a plate carrier really? How limited is your vision with a CBRN mask? And how complicated can a simple task become once you’re wearing operational gear? In our small “deployment gear challenge,” you can find out for yourself. We’ve prepared a set of playful tasks — some quick, some fiddly, some delightfully absurd. There are small prizes, plenty of laughs, and, along the way, a sense of how this gear slows you down, protects you, or sometimes just gets completely in the way.

        <abstract>English version below, this Event will be in English.&#13;
&#13;
Du hast gerade erfahren, dass einige Chaoswesen in ihrer Freizeit an ihren eigenen Suchmaschinen basteln (lies: Websuche mit eigenem Index) und bist jetzt neugierig?&#13;
&#13;
Dieses Treffen soll diejenigen, die bereits Erfahrung mit dem Bau von Suchmaschinen haben, mit denjenigen zusammenbringen, die mehr darüber wissen wollen.&#13;
&#13;
Geplantes format ist eine kurze Vorstellung gefolgt von einem "ask me anything". Wesen, die auch Fragen zu dem Thema beantworten können sind willkommen (Bitt vorher Slatian bescheid geben).&#13;
&#13;
Wenn Du bereits an einer Suchmaschine gebastelt hast, könnte dich das [Search Engine Creators Meetup](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/search-engine-creators-meetup) interessieren.&#13;
&#13;
Das Event im 39c3 Hub: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/search-engines-for-the-curious&#13;
&#13;
English:&#13;
&#13;
You've just learned that some chaos-creatures tinker with their own search engines in their free time (as in real web search with its own index) and want to know more?&#13;
&#13;
This meetup aims to bring together those who already have experience building search engines with those who want to know more about that.&#13;
&#13;
Planned format is an "ask me anything". Creatures who want to answer questions are welcome (please contact Slatian in advance). &#13;

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>Internet Governance beeinflusst, wie offen, sicher und zugänglich das Internet ist – von technischen Standards über Plattformregulierung bis hin zu Fragen von Macht und Teilhabe. In diesem interaktiven Ask Me Anything-Workshop laden wir Teilnehmende dazu ein, ihre Fragen, Zweifel und Kritik rund um Internet Governance einzubringen (unabhängig von Vorwissen).&#13;
&#13;
Der Workshop bietet einen niedrigschwelligen Einstieg in zentrale Akteure, Prozesse und Konfliktlinien der Internet Governance (z. B. Multistakeholder-Ansatz, Staaten vs. Tech-Konzerne, Global Digital Compact, WSIS, IETF, ICANN, W3C; und noch viel mehr Abkürzungen). Gleichzeitig ist Raum für vertiefende Diskussionen, persönliche Erfahrungen und aktuelle politische Aushandlungen. Ziel ist es, Internet Governance entmystifizieren, Machtstrukturen sichtbar zu machen und gemeinsam zu diskutieren, wie eine gerechtere und inklusivere digitale Zukunft aussehen kann.</abstract>

        <abstract>Digital Humanities: Forschung in den Geisteswissenschaften in digitaler Form, kurz: DH. Wir treffen uns zu einem lockeren Kennenlernen und Gedankenaustausch. Was ist Euer Interesse an den DH, wo verortet Ihr Euch in der Chaosfamilie? Welche Themen des 39C3 könnten für die DH relevant sein - und umgekehrt?</abstract>
        <description>Digital Humanities: Forschung zu Literatur, Geschichte, Sprache, Kunst, Musik in digitaler Form - von Rechercheprozessen über Analysemethoden bis hin zu Publikationsformen. Als Brückendisziplin zwischen IT und geisteswissenschaftlichen Fächern operieren die "DH" aber nicht nur anwendungsbezogen, sondern auch transformativ: Sie evaluieren kritisch im Diskurs, welche Aspekte der fortlaufenden Digitalisierung für die wissenschaftliche Praxis förderlich genutzt werden können.

Damit sorgen sie aber auch stets für Aufregung, wenn es darum geht, etablierte wissenschaftliche Prozesse zu stören: Etwa, wenn es um Open Source, Open Science, Open Data geht sowie um FAIR- und CARE-Prinzipien oder um nichtproprietäre Standards. Wir begleiten als Digital Humanists somit nicht nur die Digitalisierung von Kulturdokumenten und Wissenschaft(sbürokratie), sondern auch von Arbeitsprozessen mit dem Ziel, in diesem Zuge auch eine freiere, fairere, nachhaltigere, zugänglichere, offenere und digitalsouveränere Wissenschaftspraxis zu etablieren.

Wir schließen an die Meetups der letzten beiden Jahre an und treffen uns wieder zu einem lockeren Kennenlernen und Gedankenaustausch (siehe unser Pad dazu: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/DHMeetup). Willkommen sind alle, die an den DH interessiert sind - und vermutlich sind viele bereits in der Chaos-Familie, ohne dass wir voneinander wissen. Wo in der Chaos-Familie verortet Ihr Euch? Welche Themen des 39C3 könnten für die DH relevant sein und umgekehrt? Kommt zahlreich! Nach Bedarf können wir weitere Meetups oder SoS zu spezifischen Themen organisieren.

        <description>### Building Autonomy: Mesh Radio Hardware Workshop

Decentralized communication infrastructures require more than finished devices: understanding the hardware level enables critical engagement with proprietary designs and creates autonomy beyond commercial dependencies. The workshop covers complete assembly of an nRF52-based mesh node in Heltec form-factor, where participants gain practical comprehension of decentralized radio network architecture through soldering components, integrating LoRa modules, and installing firmware. Critical decentralization means not merely using distributed networks but mastering their technical foundations: building custom boards reveals trade-offs between energy efficiency, range, and cost, enables design adaptation to specific requirements, and develops capabilities for repairing and modifying existing infrastructure. Control over hardware design and firmware variants dissolves dependence on manufacturer decisions and permits experimental topologies that commercial solutions cannot accommodate. The workshop targets advanced participants with mesh operation experience, as technical fundamentals are prerequisite knowledge.

**Prerequisites:** Operational experience with mesh nodes (advanced)  
**Materials:** PCB kits available, pricing announced by [@jitter](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/user/jitter)

        <description>When people say Mastodon, they often mean Fediverse—on the one hand because Mastodon represents a mainstream within the Fediverse, but on the other hand because even microblogging usage patterns can vary greatly and even within Mastodon there is no uniform usage pattern, which can make Mastodon seem confusing as a term. Automated posting of RSS feeds, personal exchanges with a closed community, global networking with peers from all over the world, or individual card index boxes—we categorize different ways of using the platform and draw inspiration from unusual approaches to uncover the relevance and potential of Fediverse.

        <description>At Chaos Communication Camp 2023, padeluun called for the establishment of small, exciting companies. Digitalcourage operates a Fediverse instance that is financed by membership fees. In addition, there are commercial hosting services such as masto.host and Ossrox. What else is there, and what else is conceivable in the future? We discuss Fediverse business ideas, start-up assistance for company foundations (business plans, KfW start-up loans) and everything that can make the Fediverse an economic basis for founders. A workshop for gathering ideas, exchanging experiences and developing joint approaches. Recording of the presentation by padeluun 2023: https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57118-fediverse

        <description>In this workshop I want to work together with you on the question - what does the Fediverse offer for people not interested to run their own server or which software the software running on the server is written in. What makes the Fediverse interesting for people outside of our bubble. The results of the workshop will be published so that all ambassadors of the Fediverse can use them afterwards in their work promoting the Fediverse.

We are Europe's largest conference on the Fediverse, and perhaps even the world's largest. We look back, answer your questions and look ahead. Because after the second Berlin Fediverse Day comes the third Berlin Fediverse Day.

        <description>There may still be some version 1.5 and version 2.0 TBD friends badges left to solder. Badges contain blinking lights and 2-way communication, so the badge can tell you if there are friends around that also wear their TBD friends badge.

Soldering is done using solder paste and a hotplate. Takes about 1 hour for beginners (which mainly depends on my divergence when I talk you through it). Record time is 12 minutes.

Badges are donation-ware - Pay whatever you like to TBD. Materials costs are currently about 1.5 euro

If you miss the scheduled event, contact The0 (DECT or OFTC) - it may be possible to schedule an extra session

        <abstract>Elektrobausteine/Electric circuits with building blocks</abstract>
        <description>Make light sound or mechanical circuits. The electronic building blocks from OEM Dbolo are not only especially child-friendly due to their simple push-button connections but also a lot of fun for all ages. They are distributed by various brands, including "Kosmos Easy" and "Elenco Snap Circuits." No prior knowledge of electricity is required, but beware - learning something might happen! This is an open parent-child activity. Learn, build, and play together, and take care for arguments and that the parts don’t fall on the floor. Teenagers and adults are also welcome without child accompaniment. ;-)

        <abstract>Bei uns kannst Du sehr einfach Deiner ePA widersprechen. Hierfür haben wir für Dich ein Formular vorbereitet, dass Du ausfüllst, wir schicken das dann an Deine Krankenkasse. &#13;
Das geht auch außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten", komm einfach jederzeit vorbei, auch wenn wir nicht da sind liegt eine Anleitung aus wie das funktioniert.&#13;
Darüber hinaus bieten wir noch andere Widersprüche und Auskünfte an.</abstract>
        <description>Als gesetzlich Versicherter hast Du Anfang 2025 eine ePA erhalten, in der fortan alle Deine Behandlungsdaten (Diagnosen, Medikamente, Zahnbehandlungen, ...) protokolliert werden. Wir raten zum Widerspruch und helfen gerne dabei und stehen für Fragen zur Verfügung.

Darüber hinaus bieten wir Widerspruchsformulare gegen das Durchsuchen Deiner Abrechnungsdaten durch die Krankenkassen an. Damit will die Krankenkasse auf Basis Deiner persönlichen Daten ein sog. Risikoprofil für Dich erstellen.

Außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten" findest Du an unserem Stand eine Anleitung, die Dir zeigt wie Du Deiner ePA widersprechen kannst.

Alternativ kannst Du auch unseren Widerspruchsgenerator dafür nutzen, den Du auf unserer Webseite 'https://widerspruch-epa.de' findest.

Zusätzlich kannst Du auch eine Auskunft bei Deiner Krankenasse zu allen dort vorliegenden Daten von Dir machen.

        <abstract>Aktuell sind mir 99 deutschsprachige Fahrradpodcasts bekannt - vermutlich seit 2009. Eine eigene kleine Nische, die ich euch vorstellen möchte.</abstract>
        <description>In Zusammenarbeit mit dem grandiosen Magazin fahrstil habe ich 2024 alle deutschsprachigen Fahrradpodcasts herausgesucht - es waren ca. 70. Mittlerweile sind es 99 und ich bin mir sicher, immer noch nicht Alle gelistet zu haben: https://podcasts.regines-radsalon.de

Was hat es mit dieser Podcaster*innen-Community auf sich und was lässt sich mit so einer Sammlung anstellen? Erstaunlich ist, daß fast alle gefundenen Podcasts noch vollständig im Netz auffindbar sind.

Es bleibt vermutlich work in progress in vielerlei Hinsicht. Manches geht und ist sogar unterhaltsam wie etwa die FahrradPodcastAdventsrallye, die im Dezember 2025 zum dritten Mal im Fediverse stattfinden wird. Anderes wird vermutlich nie richtig funktionieren wie etwa konsistente Daten aller deutschsprachigen Fahrradpodcasts zu etwa dem Genderverhältnis der Gästys zu bekommen.

        <abstract>In this talk, you will learn how Apple Silicon hardware differs from regular laptops or desktops.&#13;
We'll cover how we reverse engineered the hardware without staring at disassembly but by using a thin hypervisor that traces all MMIO access and then wrote Linux drivers.&#13;
We'll also talk about how upstreaming to the Linux kernel works and how we've significantly decreased our downstream patches in the past year.&#13;
&#13;
As an example, we will use support for the Type-C ports and go into details why these are so complex and required changes across multi subsystems.&#13;

        <abstract>How can we predict soil moisture by measuring cosmic ray products and what have trains to do with it? Ever wondered how this Dürremonitor works, that you heared about in ther german news? These question and some more I will try to answer while I give an overview of some of the research that is done by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ).</abstract>
        <description>The Dürremonitor is a programme that is often mentioned in the German news when some regions experience drought. Alongside the Dürremonitor and the underlying Mesoscale Hydrological Model (MHM), there is ongoing research at the UFZ concerning soil moisture. Some of these studies involve measuring soil moisture using a technique called cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Rather than taking measurements, the MHM uses a physics-based model incorporating precipitation forecasts to predict drought or flood. These two strategies for quantifying soil moisture are therefore in opposition: the measurement-based approach (CRNS) and the modelling-based approach (MHM/Dürremonitor). CRNS is a relatively new method of measuring soil moisture based on the proportion of neutrons reflected by the soil (the principles were discovered in the 1980s, but it has only recently become commercially applicable). This method has several advantages over previous soil moisture measurement methods: it is non-invasive, easy to set up, portable and can therefore be used on trains.

In the talk I will give an overview of the Dürremonitor and MHM and then focus on CRNS. I will explain the physical principles behind the method, how it is implemented in practice by making serveys using trains.

        <abstract>Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED), such as cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, are a fairly niche target for security researchers, in part due to a lack of manufacturer cooperation and device accessibility. This talk aims to provide insights into the challenges in device development and methods with which to research device security. Data accessibility to patients will be touched upon.</abstract>
        <description>CIEDs may adversely affect patients implanted with such devices should their security be compromised. Although some efforts to secure these devices can be noted, it has quite often been lacking and may thus enable patient harm or data confidentiality compromise by malicious actors. Given the vast consequences of security vulnerabilities within this industry, the author aims to provide insight into the challenges associated with designing security architectures for such platforms, as well as possible methodology of researching these devices safely even when lacking manufacturer cooperation and access to device programmers.

Data collected by CIEDs and transmitted through remote monitoring is an additional concern for patients. Whilst research has shown that most manufacturers do respond in a timely and comprehensive fashion to GDPR requests, immediate data access is not yet possible and requires the patient to reach out to their doctors to obtain the requisite (event) data. A proposed solution is presented on how a patient communicator may be designed to allow patients interested in their autonomy to perform limited device interrogation in a safe and secure manner.

        <title>Breaking BOTS: Cheating at Blue Team CTFs with AI Speed-Runs</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <language>en</language>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>Talk</type>
        <abstract>After we announced our results, CTFs like Splunk's Boss of the SOC (BOTS) started prohibiting AI agents. For science &amp; profit, we keep doing it anyways. In BOTS, the AIs solve most of it in under 10 minutes instead of taking the full day. Our recipe was surprisingly simple: Teach AI agents to self-plan their investigation steps, adapt their plans to new information, work with the SIEM DB, and reason about log dumps. No exotic models, no massive lab budgets - just publicly available LLMs mixed with a bit of science and perseverance. We'll walk through how that works, including videos of the many ways AI trips itself up that marketers would rather hide, and how to do it at home with free and open-source tools.&#13;
&#13;
CTF organizers can't detect this - the arms race is probably over before it really began. But the real question isn't "can we cheat at CTFs?" It's what happens when investigations evolve from analysts-who-investigate to analysts-who-manage-AI-investigators. We'll show you what that transition already looks like today and peek into some uncomfortable questions about what comes next.</abstract>
        <description>THE PLAN

Live demonstrations of AI agents speed-running blue team challenges, including the failure modes that break investigations. We'll show both what happens when we try the trivial approaches like “just have claude do it”, “AI workflows”, and what ultimately worked, like managed self-planning, semantic SIEM layers, and log agents. Most can be done with free and open tools and techniques on the cheap, so we will walk through that as well.

THE DEEP DIVE

* Why normal prompts and static AI workflows fail
* Self-planning investigation agents that evolve task lists dynamically
* What we mean by semantic layers for calling databases and APIs
* How to handle millions of log events without bankrupting yourself
* Why "no AI" rules are misguided technically and conceptually

GOING BEYOND CTFS

The same patterns that trivialize training exercises work on real SOC investigations. We're watching blue team work fundamentally transform - from humans investigating to humans managing AI investigators. Training programs teaching skills AI already automates. Hiring practices that can't verify who's doing the work. Certifications losing meaning. More fundamentally, when we talk about who watches the watchers, a lot is about to shift again.

        <abstract>*What are atoms doing in space anyways?* This talk will provide a brief overview of applications of quantum technologies in space ranging from precise timing and inertial measurements to fundamental physics.</abstract>
        <description>Quantum technologies have seen a wide field of applications in medicine, geosciences, computing and communications, in many cases bridging the gap from laboratory experiments to commercial products in the last decade. For terrestrial applications that is. But what about going to space?

Quantum physics based sensors and experiments promise higher accuracy, sensitivity or better long term stability as they rely on immutable properties of atoms. When properly manipulated, these (ultra-)cold atoms are likely to outperform state of the art instruments. Experiments conducted on sounding rockets demonstrated important steps like Bose-Einstein Condensate creation during a few minutes in microgravity, enabling more advanced quantum experiments in the future.  The International Space Station and the Tiangong Space Station host dedicated experiments like ultrastable clocks as well as flexible research infrastructure for fundamental research benefitting from long free-fall times. However, the deployment of such technologies on satellites is not as advanced. Satellite missions utilizing quantum sensors or performing long term experiments are subject to studies and proposals backed by a broad scientific community aiming at better understanding of climate change, interplanetary navigation or tests of general relativity. First steps towards realization of such missions are taken by ESA, NASA and various national space agencies as well as universities funded by national agencies or the EU.

This talk will detect the current state of atoms in space and give an overview of active programs to deploy quantum sensors on operational satellite missions. The focus is on future applications in geosciences and related fields employing the same technology.

        <abstract>Stellt euch vor, eine private Organisation aus milliardenschweren Konzernen entscheidet, welche Webseiten ihr nicht besuchen dürft - ohne Richter, ohne öffentliche Kontrolle oder Transparenz. &#13;
Genau das macht die CUII in Deutschland seit Jahren.</abstract>
        <description>In Deutschland entscheidet eine private Organisation aus Internetanbietern und großen Unterhaltungskonzernen, welche Webseiten für den Großteil der Bevölkerung nicht mehr erreichbar sind. 
Die selbsternannte "Clearingstelle Urheberrecht im Internet" sperrt ohne richterliche Beschlüsse den Zugriff auf Hunderte von Domains. 
Wir haben daraufhin cuiiliste.de ins Leben gerufen, um die geheim gehaltene Liste von Domains zu veröffentlichen und so mehr Transparenz in die heimliche Zensur der Konzerne zu bringen.
Unsere Auswertung der Liste zeigte: Fast ein Drittel der gesperrten Domains erfüllte – teils seit Jahren – nicht mehr die Kriterien für eine Sperre.
Wir werden uns ansehen, wie dutzende Domains nach öffentlichem Druck wieder entsperrt wurden, während Provider gleichzeitig deren Sperren noch mehr verschleierten.
Vor ein paar Monaten soll sich angeblich viel geändert haben bei der CUII - doch diese Änderung sieht leider verdächtig nach einem PR-Stunt aus, um weiterhin Seiten ohne Transparenz sperren zu können.

        <abstract>Abbreviations such as WSIS+20, IGF, IETF, DIEM, ICANN, PDP, ITU or W3C regularly appear in discussions about the Internet, yet often remain vague. This talk provides an update on the current state of Internet governance and explains why decisions made in United Nations processes have direct implications for technical standards, digital infrastructure, and power asymmetries.</abstract>
        <description>The starting point is the UN’s WSIS+20 review process, which negotiated the future of the Internet Governance Forum and the roles of stakeholders within it. Against this backdrop, the talk traces the origins of the so-called multistakeholder approach and examines how it works in practice and where its limits lie.

What role do technical standardization organizations such as the IETF, ICANN, ITU or the W3C play in an increasingly geopolitical environment? Who sets the rules, who defines the standards, and who is left out of these processes?

The aim of the talk is to make the connections between technology and international politics visible and to explain why Internet governance matters to everyone interested in an open, global, and interoperable Internet.

        <abstract>Willkommen in der Zukunft: Beim LUG Camp in Wipperfürth und bei den Datenspuren in Dresden wurde digital bezahlt - mit GNU Taler als Event-Bezahlsystem. Noch einfacher als Bargeld, billiger als Kartenzahlung und ohne Eingriff in die Privatsphäre der Besucher*innen. Wir zeigen euch, wie auch ihr das bei eurer nächsten (Chaos-)Veranstaltung anbieten könnt!</abstract>
        <description>Anonymes Bezahlen ganz ohne Bargeld? Digitales Bezahlen ohne Gebühren auf jede einzelne Transaktion? Keine zentrale Datensammelei bei US-amerikanischen Zahlungsanbietern, und trotzdem keine Blockchain?

Geht nicht? Geht doch! Schon auf mehreren Veranstaltungen wurde [GNU Taler](https://www.taler.net/) erfolgreich als lokales Event-Bezahlsystem eingesetzt: Sämtliche Zahlungen beim [LUG Camp 2024](https://lugcamp.wuplug.org/) wurden dank GNU Taler ausschließlich digital durchgeführt. Ebenso wurde mehr als ein Viertel des Umsatzes bei den [Datenspuren 2025](https://datenspuren.de/2025/) mit GNU Taler digital abgewickelt.

Während die GLS Bank im Rahmen des EU-geförderten Projekts NGI Taler ein [deutschlandweites Angebot](https://www.gls.de/taler) vorbereitet, hatten unsere Besucher*innen bereits jetzt die Gelegenheit, anonymes digitales Bezahlen in der echten Welt zu testen. Das positive Feedback und der reibungslose Ablauf haben uns gezeigt: GNU Taler ist einsatzbereit und kommt in der Community super an!

Deshalb wollen wir unsere Erfahrungen mit GNU Taler als Eventbezahlsystem gerne an Orgateams von anderen (Chaos-)Veranstaltungen weitergeben. Nach einer Einführung zur Funktionsweise von GNU Taler berichten wir von der praktischen Umsetzung beim LUGCamp und bei den Datenspuren und geben Tipps für alle, die GNU Taler auch bei ihrem nächsten Event anbieten wollen.

        <abstract>I wanted to design beautiful header diagrams and ASCII tables suitable for stitching on throw pillows, but found existing tools for cross-stitch design to be all wrong. I made my own set of command-line tools for building this chunky, pixelated visual art. If you've never seen a cross-stitch sampler that had bitrot, this talk will fix it.</abstract>
        <description>Designing cross-stitch patterns, I got frustrated with all the programs which expected me to click around a canvas setting individual pixels. I wanted a cross-stitch design software suite that I could drive with a Makefile, which could give me an interactive interface for stitching or compile them to PDF. In short, I wanted to say `echo "shutdown -h now" | embellish --border | export pattern --pdf` and get a design worthy of stitching on a pillow.

So, I made the thing I wanted. I'll discuss the many yak shaves along the way (proprietary file format reverse-engineering, OAuth2, what 'color' even means, unikernel hosting, and more). I'll talk a bit about the joy of making something so you can make something, and how it feels to craft software that is unapologetically personal.

        <abstract>The end of free support for Windows 10 was 14 October 2025. Well, sort of. Microsoft moved the date to 2026, one more year the FOSS community can introduce users to sustainable software. 14 October is also KDE's birthday, International E-Waste Day, with International Repair Day following on 18 October. The irony is deep, but what is not ironic is that millions of functioning computers will end up becoming security risks or discarded as e-waste. This means manufacturing and transporting new ones, the biggest waste of all: hardware production accounts for over 75% of a device's CO2 emissions over its lifespan.&#13;
&#13;
The FOSS community had an opportunity and we took it! In 2024, KDE Eco's Opt Green project began a global, unified campaign across FOSS and repair communities to upgrade unsupported Windows 10 computers to Linux. We held BoFs at SFSCon, CCC, and FOSDEM. We thought big and acted boldly. In this talk End Of 10 contributors will discuss the campaign, what has worked and what the challenges have been, and how FOSS provides a solution to software-driven resource and energy consumption.</abstract>
        <description>This is a talk about digital sustainability and the role software plays in hardware longevity. At the 38C3, the End Of 10 campaign held a workshop to co-ordinate contributions across FOSS communities. Many people currently involved started contributing after this workshop, including 2 of the 3 presenters.

        <abstract>Der Hype um generative KI und die Gasindustrie bilden in Zeiten der Klimakrise eine bedrohliche Allianz für die Zukunft des Planeten.</abstract>
        <description>Obwohl die negativen Klimaauswirkungen generativer KI immer deutlicher werden, sollen in ganz Europa Großrechenzentren gebaut werden und Deutschland „KI-Nation“ werden, was ungeahnte „Wirtschaftskräfte freisetzen soll“ – zumindest, wenn es nach der Bundesregierung geht.

Der Ausbau der Recheninfrastruktur für generative KI benötigt viel Energie, Wasser und Ressourcen, was global zu Umweltschäden führt. Prognosen für die EU zeigen, dass der Energieverbrauch in Zukunft so groß werden könnte, dass der Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien nicht mithalten kann – doch die fossile Industrie steht bereits in den Startlöchern.

Der Hype um generative KI liefert ihnen die perfekte Begründung für den Ausbau fossiler Infrastruktur- mitten in der eskalierenden Klimakrise. Tech- und Fossilkonzerne investieren massiv in neue Gaskraftwerke für energiehungrige Rechenzentren.  Dabei ist der wirtschaftliche Nutzen und die Wertschöpfung durch die Technologie weiterhin unklar.
Klar ist: wir erleben derzeit eine fossile Gegenoffensive im Gewand digitaler Versprechen. Auf Kosten des Klimas und der Zukunft.

Dieser Vortrag schließt an den Talk "Klimaschädlich by Design" vom 38C3 an und gibt Updates zu Entwicklungen in Deutschland und Europa.

        <abstract>We explore what happens when Europe’s ambitious data access laws meet the messy realities of studying major digital platforms. Using YouTube as a central case, we show how the European Union’s efforts to promote transparency through the GDPR, the Digital Services Act (DSA), and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) are reshaping the possibilities and limits of independent platform research.&#13;
&#13;
At the heart of the discussion is a paradox: while these laws promise unprecedented access to the data that shape our digital lives, the information researchers and citizens actually receive is often incomplete, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. &#13;
&#13;
In this talk, we take a close look at data donations from over a thousand Danish YouTube users, which at first glance did not reveal neat insights but sprawling file structures filled with cryptic data points. Still, if the work is put in, these digital traces offer glimpses of engagement and attention, and help us understand what users truly encountered or how the platform influenced their experiences.&#13;
&#13;
The talk situates this challenge within a broader European context, showing how data access mechanisms are set up in ways that strengthen existing power imbalances. Application processes for research data vary widely, requests are rejected or delayed without clear justification, and the datasets that do arrive frequently lack the granularity required for meaningful analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Yet the picture is not purely bleak. Citizens, researchers, and civil society already have multiple legal levers to demand greater transparency and accountability. The fundamental question is no longer whether democratic oversight is possible, but how we can use the tools at hand to make it real.</abstract>
        <description>**Talk Description**
In this talk, we explore what happens when the European Union’s data access laws meet the practical realities of platform research. The talk opens with a shared introduction, where David and LK set the stage: why social media platforms like YouTube matter for democracy and what the EU has done to make them more transparent.

LK will then provide a short introduction into the legally mandated ways we can currently use to access platform data: from the GDPR’s right of access, the research data access provisions in the DSA, to the portability obligations into the DMA. But access is not the same as insight, a lesson David learned the hard way. Along with his team he invited over a thousand Danes to make use of their GDPR-right to their own data and donate their YouTube watch histories, searches, subscriptions and comments. Using the DSA, the team then obtained meta-data on the millions of videos the data donors had interacted with. The goal: Seeing what the digital data traces YouTube collects from its users can tell us about the platform’s effect on people’s lives and society. Are the data carrying indicators of polarization, loneliness, political extremism or any of the numerous other ails of society that YouTube has been suspected to cause? However, the data are difficult to get a hold of, messy, not properly annotated, and parsing them requires an almost archeological mindset. Together, we will peek behind the Youtube curtain, shine a light on what platform data actually looks like, and sketch out what can and cannot be learned from them.

All around Europe, researchers are currently facing similar challenges, parsing cryptic user and platform data from Facebook and TikTok to porn sites and Zalando. The platforms implement the data access laws to achieve minimal compliance but not to provide meaningful transparency. Data gathered by the DSA40 Data Access Collaboratory shows that application forms vary widely, researchers are rejected for non-compliant reasons, and applications artificially stalled. Other researchers have shown that the data received through some of the APIs is incomplete and inaccurate. In short: there is a lot of space for improvement. But we do not need to wait for investigations into platform compliance to conclude.. The basic conditions for democratic oversight have been set, which means that theoretically various legal ways into the platforms exist for citizens, researchers and civil society. The question that remains is which levers to use to practically realise as much of this potential as possible.

**About the Presenters**
David Wegmann is a PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark. He researches social media and its societal effects using data science. As part of DATALAB, he led the analysis of donated data for “Data donation as a method for investigating trends and challenges in digital media landscapes at national scale: The Danish population’s use of YouTube as an illustrative case” by Bechmann and colleagues (2025).

LK Seiling coordinates the DSA40 Data Access Collaboratory, where they research the implementation of the DSA’s data access provisions. At the Weizenbaum Institute Berlin, they are also looking into research engineering and data access as well as technologically mediated risks for individuals, society, and science.

        <abstract>The Four Freedoms (defined ~40 years ago) and the Four Opens (~15 years ago) for Open Source provided canonical definitions for what are the cornerstones of Open Source Software communities today. While the ethos still applies today, the cultural norms that blossomed to put it into practice are from an era with different challenges.&#13;
&#13;
To build a better world, we need to both keep and protect the value system of the Four Freedoms and Four Opens. To do that, we need to re-assess our risk and threat models to balance that allows beautiful minds to flourish as well as introduce responsible friction to prevent harm from coming to them.</abstract>
        <description>The state of the internet, c 1990:

* Limited, opt-in connectivity: people had to both have access to a computer and that computer had to have access to the internet.
* Tooling required some in-industry knowledge to be able to run and use, not only for development but also for communication.
* Open source was a young movement. The "common source" was proprietary.

The state of the internet, c 2025:

* Always online, might-not-even-be-to-opt-out connectivity: devices are almost always collecting and transmitting data, including audio/visual, in some cases even if "turned off".
* Easy to use tooling has made it easier for everyone to come together. The pervasiveness of technology also means that most people, of any background, can easily access other people in the thousands or even millions.
* Open source is common, accessible, and matured. A $9 **_trillion_** resource. Yes, **_trillion_**.

These three significant changes drastically change the threat model for OSS communities. In the beginning, someone had to have both knowledge and resources to harm or otherwise compromise a community of developers. Now, anyone with a grudge can make a bot army with seamless integrations and gracious freemium tiers for AI/LLMs. Likewise, when open source was small, the "who" who would be motivated to harm and otherwise disrupt those communities was limited. Now there is both massive social and economic benefit to harm and disrupt. This means that risks and threats now still include the motivated and resourced **_with the addition of_** those who are scarce in both.

We need to come together to build new organizational threat models that account for how this consequence has posed new risks to our communities. With care and attention to detail, we can introduce responsible friction that will protect our communication infrastructure, the lifeblood of what allows open source to grow.

There will also be a workshop with this presentation, with the outcome of creating an ongoing working group dedicated to helping OSS Foundations of all sizes protect their communities.

There will be a workshop about the same topic on 12.30, Day 4: [https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/how-to-keep-open-source-open-without-leaving-our-c](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/de/event/detail/how-to-keep-open-source-open-without-leaving-our-c)

        <abstract>Encoding isn’t just for machines — it’s how humans shape meaning. This talk traces 35 years of hacking text through the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), a community-driven, open-source standard for describing the deep structure of texts. We’ll explore how TEI turns literature, research, and even hacker lore into machine-readable, remixable data — and how it enables minimal, sustainable self-publishing without gatekeepers. From alphabets to XML and the Hacker Bible, we’ll look at text as a living system: something we can read, write, and hack together.</abstract>
        <description>Computers can’t do much without encoding. They need ways to turn bytes into symbols, words, and meaning — to make text readable for both humans and machines. But encoding isn’t just for machines. Humans also encode: we describe, structure, and translate our thoughts into text. And while the number of text formats seems endless (and keeps growing), that’s not a bug — it’s a feature. Diversity in encoding is how we learn what works and what doesn’t.

Long before ASCII tables or Unicode, text encoding already existed — in alphabets, printing presses, and typographic systems. Every technology of writing has been a way of hacking language into matter: from clay tablets to lead letters, from code pages to Markdown. Each era brings new formats and new constraints — and with them, new genres, new rules, new cultural codes. Think of poetry and protocol manuals, fairy tales and README files, the Hacker Bible itself — all shaped by the tools and conventions that carry them.

So here’s the question: can we encode not only what we see, but what we mean? Can we capture a poem’s rhythm, a play’s voices, or the alternate endings of a story — and do it in a way that’s open, remixable, and machine-readable?

Turns out, yes — and the solution has existed since 1988. It’s called the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), a long-running open-source standard that lets you describe the structure, semantics, and context of texts using XML. You can think of it as a humanities fork of hypertext — an extensible markup language for everything from medieval manuscripts to memes.

TEI is more than a format: it’s a collaborative, living standard maintained by an international community of researchers, librarians, and digital humanists. It evolves with the world — adding elements for new text types (like social media posts) and for changing cultural realities (like non-binary gender markers). It embodies open science principles and keeps publishing in the hands of its creators.

You don’t need a publisher, a platform, or a big server farm. Just an XML-aware text editor, a few lines of CSS, and maybe a Git repo. From there, you can transform your encoded text into websites, PDFs, e-books — or share it directly in its raw, readable, hackable form. It’s sustainable, transparent, and low-energy. It even challenges the academic prestige economy by making every individual contribution visible — from editors to annotators to script writers.

In this talk, we’ll look at text as code and code as culture, from alphabets to XML, and explore how TEI can be a tool for hacking not machines but meaning itself. We’ll end with a practical example: a TEI-encoded page of the first Hacker Bible — because our own history also deserves to be archived, shared, and forked.

        <description>Stored memory in hardware has had a long history of being influenced by light, by design. For instance, as memory is represented by the series of transistors, and their physical state represents 1's and 0's, original EPROM memory could be erased via the utilization of UV light, in preparation for flashing new memory.

Naturally, whilst useful, this also has proven to be an avenue of opportunity to be leveraged by attackers, allowing them to selectively influence memory via a host of optical/light-based techniques. As chips became more advanced, the usage of opaque resin was used as a "temporary" measure to combat this flaw, by coating chips in a material that would reflect undesirable UV.

Present day opinions are that laser (or light) based hardware attacks, are something that only nation state actors are capable of doing; due to both limitations of cost in tooling as well as personnel expertise required. Currently, sophisticated hardware labs use expensive, high frequency IR beams to penetrate the resin.

This project demonstrates that with a limited budget and hacker-and-maker mentality, similar results can be obtained at a fraction of the cost, from the comfort of your home or garage. With the modifications of an opensource low-cost microscope, addition of a home-built beam splitter and interchangeable diode laser, it has been shown that consumer-grade diodes are capable of producing results similar to the high-cost variants, such as the YAG lasers.

One example of results includes introducing affordable avenues to conduct laser-based fault injection, via the usage of such budget-friendly tooling. We are opening the study of these low-level hardware attacking methodologies to more entry-level security testers, without the need for hundreds of thousands of dollars in startup capital.

By leveraging more affordable technology alternatives, we have embarked on a mission to uncover hardware malware, detect supply-chain chip replacements, and delve into the realm of laser-logic-state imaging. Our approach integrates optics, laser selection, and machine learning components.

        <abstract>Keeping old projects working can be an uphill battle.  This talk explores how the laser tag system Q-Zar (Quasar in the UK) has been kept alive since the company behind it failed in the 90s.   The challenges encountered, the lessons learnt, and how those can be applied to our own future projects to maximise the project lifetime.</abstract>
        <description>Looking at the effects of obsolescence in the context of a laser tag system from the 1980s Q-Zar (Quasar in the UK), what needed to happen to keep it going to enable people to continue playing.  What lessons we can learn from that and some good examples from other projects, and how that can be applied to our own projects.

This talk covers the electronics involved in the laser tag system, why the continued availability of components has varied a lot.  The need to develop new computer software that continues to work years later.  The way the physical equipment can have its life extended.

Topics covered range from electronics design through to software coding and onto physical unit repair. A look at the tooling created to help maintain, support and repair the laser tag packs.  The challenges Covid-19 created and how things were rapidly pivoted to enable continued playing in challenging times.
This is about how we all can make simple decisions that help build something that will last the maximum time possible with the least amount of effort.

        <abstract>An invitation to discover classical music patterns and new music by listening carefully and letting go.</abstract>
        <description>A calm, open-ended programme for curious listening. A shared space where unfamiliar ideas can settle and reveal themselves over time, created by the unfolding of pieces by composers of different eras, schools and genres. Nothing is required beyond a willingness to listen and stay awhile. Well suited to joining the lounge, taking a seat, and discovering something quietly unexpected.

        <abstract>Finona Rider is a Hamburg based artist.&#13;
Renowned for her vibrant sets and relentless crate-digging for record rarities, she carries the spirits of Phantasia and remains a pillar of the city’s underground.&#13;
Where dancefloor rush meets quiet mind, she´s mostly into blending early-2000s minimal, rare electro, and house-infused old-school psytrance in her DJ-sets, while her productions swing between sonic journeys and introspection.</abstract>
        <description>My journey into sound has been a lifelong passion, but my deep love for dancefloor-related electronic music truly ignited through attending raves in my hometown. Time after time, I immersed myself in arts, including studies in systematic musicology, event techniques and audio engineering, while working at Remoto-Records and surrounding myself with inspiring people who encouraged me to bring my ideas to life. This also led me to experiment with analogue sounds, which gradually evolved into producing.
Since I began playing my sets at several dancefloors across Germany and beyond in 2018, my connection with music has become increasingly intense and adventurous. For the past five years, I have been organizing events with my collective Phantasia at various locations, creating unique spaces for musical exploration. At the end of 2024, we launched our own label, where you can find my very first release on wax.
I also perform under my artist alias problem.child, where I focus on CD-only sets featuring 90s and early 2000s Goa and progressive-house.
Additionally, I hold a bi-monthly residency for my show Exo-Drive on London-based radio station Komrad 94, as well as for my concept Großstadtromantik, which takes an experimental approach, on Koska Radio in Maastricht.

Nachdem in diesem Talk wahrscheinlich viel über Bürgergeld und "neue Grundsicherung" geredet wurde, gehen wir hier in einem praktischen Austausch zu einem selbstbewussten Umgang mit dem ganzen Scheiß. Es geht um Tipps, Tricks und Hacks im alltäglichen Umgang mit dem Jobcenter. Die Referentin bezieht bereits seit mehreren Jahren unsanktioniert Bürgergeld, ohne auch nur einen einzigen Termin wahrgenommen zu haben, aber das ganze soll mehr ein offener Austausch sein, bei dem alle etwas beitragen können, als ein linearer Vortrag.

        <description>I made a bargain, now I have to keep up my end of the deal.

This is the 10x sped-up version of my other talk on day 1 -- for the ADHD crowd, for anyone who missed the first talk, or for those that just wanna enjoy the show and have a laugh.

[https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/hacking-medical-research-for-a-better-transition](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/hacking-medical-research-for-a-better-transition)

This is a speedrun. I cannot select less than 25 minutes, but I do not intend to go over 5 minutes unless I have to reset. I would prefer to do this as lightning talk, but I'm not sure they support LiveSplit.

        <description>So wie das Fantasy-Genre oft das Mittelalter abbildet und weiterdenkt, kann man sich auch in der Science Fiction an der realen Geschichte orientieren, vor allem dann, wenn sie realistisch sein soll.

Wie entstehen neue Technologien? Wie sind sie früher entstanden? Wird alles immer größer, oder auch einmal kleiner und effizienter? Wie entwickeln sich Gesellschaften und Konflikte? Welche wirtschaftlichen und infrastrukturellen Voraussetzungen braucht es, um kilometergroße Battleships zu bauen? Wie viele Menschen passen eigentlich auf die Erde? Was bedeutet Postapokalypse im historischen Kontext? Warum sollten wir das Sonnensystem besiedeln und Planeten terraformen? Falls es Aliens gibt, sind wir dann Forscher, Siedler und Eroberer? Oder sind wir eher die Eroberten, wie einst die Bewohner der Pazifikinseln?

Viel Material für eine realistische Geschichte der Zukunft, basierend auf realer Wissenschaft und historischen Mustern.

        <description>Since a couple of years, I've been using a custom cursor theme – the cursor is a turtle emoji! Sometimes I forget that it exists, and people are amused that there's a turtle on my screen! :D

In this workshop, I'll explain how cursor themes work on Linux, and teach you how to generate your own one! It could be anything you want – some ideas:

- Draw your own arrows (cool-looking? Weird ones?)
- Repurpose your favorite icons/logos (so that everyone immediately knows that you're using Arch btw)
- Blåhajs?!
- High-contrast cursors that are actually more accessible to you

Bring a Linux laptop! And it'd be ideal if you could already install the vector graphics program Inkscape and the command line tool `xcursorgen`! I'll show you a little script that will help you generate the theme.

The resulting themes work both on X.Org as well as Wayland.

        <description>Meetup - Revival of 37C3 and 38C3

We want to get to know each other (better) and chat about the everyday madness of living in a neurotypical world.

Anyone who identifies as neurodivergent, particularly those with ADHD and/or autism, is welcome to join us.

No official diagnosis is necessary. If you don't have one or are still unsure, you are just as welcome. :-)

We'll start by collecting topics and then form discussion groups on these topics at individual tables. It is possible to switch tables during the event.

Feel free to join us even after the event has started.
There's no such thing as being late with us, we'll be there until the end of the SOS and are happy to see more of you. &lt;3

        <description>A meetup for steno enthusiasts, users &amp; those interested in stenography (both machine stenography &amp; shorthand)

There will be a short introduction presentation on how machine stenography works (specifically the Plover theory, as that is freely available &amp; the one I'm most familiar with), and I'll also bring all my hardware so you can try it out on your own devices - you do need Plover installed on your own laptop though to be able to use that hardware (https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover).

I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of hardware &amp; theories others are using, so do bring your things ^^

(If enough people show up we'd just continue after the 25min somewhere else)

        <description>**Today we are pulling down our tents.** We are meeting as vegan hacktivists and beings with an interest in animal rights and sustainability for a farewell meeting - to look back together on what we have experienced and to make concrete arrangements: How do we continue organising the Vegan Chaos Community? What are the next ideas, plans and projects?

There will also be opportunities for personal get-togethers after the Congress: Is a Vegan Chaos travelling group forming for other Chaos events? What else could happen next? Come along, let's put our heads together!

        <abstract>This workshop is to establish a longer term working group that will threat model and abusability test (different from abuse test) common open source governance and community frameworks. The primary focus of this session is for Phase 1 preparation: communications norms around this project.</abstract>
        <description>Recent years have seen an increase in stress and pressure resulting from both actor and non-actor harms due to the pivot in how we manage our OSS communities in digital spaces. To better equip the broader OSS community with how to document, detect, and handle these issues we need to threat model and abusability test common governance and community frameworks and publish relevant guidance.

In this session, we are starting with Phase 1: building communication norms. This is because the work that follows carries inherent risk as we identify, research, and model these frameworks. We'll also publish our recommended communications practices regarding sensitive information in open source.

        <description>What if your browser bookmarks didn't just save an address, but unlocked a whole arsenal of features? I'll show you how to unleash the power of the modern web directly from your bookmarks bar with bookmarklets. Whether it's webcam access, clipboard hacks, full-screen action or spontaneous library reloading, this talk is a firework display for anyone who loves JavaScript and wants to push boundaries. There are also tips on minification, troubleshooting, and even creating blobs and playing sounds. Nerdy, practical, surprising – a must for web tinkerers and JavaScript Jedis 🥷

        <description>In this workshop we will learn how to make easy transdermal HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) products for trans people ourselves!

The two variants are sprays and gels, there are enough base ingredients for both.

I forgot to register this workshop earlier but you can just join us at any time at our assembly Projekt31 for a workshop.

        <description>In dieser Session zeigen wir, wie Ihr in weniger als 20 Minuten und Kosten für Hardware von weniger als 30 Euro einen Werbefilter bauen könnt. 
Vorkenntnisse: keine außer allgemeine Neugier
Hardwareanforderungen: keine (für die Präsentation), falls Ihr mitmachen möchtet irgend ein Microcomputer mit RasPiOs oder Debian und SSH

Hintergrund: bei vielen Endgeräten bzw. Softwareprodukten ist es immer schwerer, Werbung und Tracking herauszufiltern (insbesondere bei Smartphones).  Dort sind die Plugins wie UBlock Origin entweder nicht verfügbar oder sie gelten nur für den Browser und nicht für die Apps. Die Lösung ist, auf dem Weg in das Internet einfach eine Sperrliste zu haben, die alle Verbindungen zu Werbeanbietern blockt. Eine gängige OpenSource Lösung ist PiHole. Es braucht nur minimale Hardware. Ein Raspberry Pi für weniger als 30 Euro reicht dafür aus oder ein alter Computer, der sonst keine Aufgabe mehr hat. In der Session zeigen wir wie einfach es ist, ein PiHole aufzusetzen und in das Heimnetzwerk einzubinden.  Seid gespannt auf das neue Nutzungserlebnis eines Internets (fast) ohne Werbung. Am Ende der Session stellen wir eine detaillierte Anleitung zur Verfügung. Damit könnt Ihr das Gezeigte zu Hause "nachbauen" könnt.

        <abstract>„Hattest du einen schönen Congress?“ „Ja klar, also…ähm…was erzähle ich jetzt?“&#13;
Der Congress ist intensiv. Er inspiriert, überfordert, überrascht und berührt. Gemeinsam extrahieren wir unsortierte Congress-Erlebnisse aus dem Cache und booten neu.</abstract>
        <description>Gar nicht so einfach, in Worte zu fassen, was zwischen LEDs und Gesprächen, Vorträgen und Hallen, Workshops und Zufallsmomenten entsteht. in diesem Workshop erproben wir Methoden des kreativen und ethnographischen Schreibens. Wir schreiben für uns allein und kollaborativ, ausgehend vom Congress, über uns und diese Welt.

Schreiben kann mehr sein als eine Technologie, um sensorische Signale zu speichern. Schreibend lässt sich reflektieren und die Welt gestalten. Schreiben ist in diesem Sinne eine politische Praxis. Die Geschichten, die wir über die Welt erzählen und uns darin erzählen, prägen, was wir für möglich halten. Kultur, Wissen, Weltordnungen werden von Menschen geschrieben, gelesen und weitergetragen. Wenn wir selbst zu Schreibenden werden, können wir diese Geschichten anders erzählen, verschieben und aufbrechen. Hier knüpfen wir an „speculative fabulations“ (Donna Haraway) an: die Idee, neue Zukünfte zu erfinden, indem wir anders erzählen.
Wir begreifen ethnografisches Schreiben als eine Praxis des „reflecting selves and others“: eine Form, die uns erlaubt wahrzunehmen, wie wir selbst und andere in Beziehung stehen, sich bewegen, fühlen, handeln.

Mit praktischen Übungen, kleinen Inputs und gemeinsamen Diskussionen probieren wir verschiedene Zugänge aus: vom freien Schreiben über Vignetten bis hin zu kollaborativen Texten, die aus unseren Congress-Erlebnissen heraus entstehen.

Vorkenntnisse sind nicht erforderlich, aber willkommen. Bringt euch angenehmes Schreibzeug mit: Laptop, Telefon oder Papier und Stift. Zusätzlich haben wir auch Papier und Stifte da.

        <abstract>Zielgruppe für diesen Workshop sind be_hinderte Congress-Besucher:innen (CCCrips). Eine Hackspace- oder C3-Mitgliedschaft ist komplett optional. Wir wollen uns untereinander kennenlernen, Erfahrungen austauschen, und Pläne schmieden! Weltherrschaft, anyone?</abstract>
        <description>Inhalte bzw. Ziel: Vernetzung! Endlich mal "diese Leute aus dem Internet" kennenlernen. Erfahrungen austauschen. Ideen sammeln, wie Dinge vor Ort und für zukünftige Events zugänglich(er) gemacht werden. 
Seit der ersten Auskotzrunde am 37C3 sind einige neue Kontakte und digitale Räume zum Austausch über die Veranstaltung hinweg entstanden.

Klärung: Be_hinderung kann viele verschiedene Formen haben. Wir wollen hier einen Raum schaffen, in dem viele verschiedene Menschen sich miteinander austauschen können. 
Eine "offizielle" Diagnose ist dafür absolut nicht notwendig! Wenn du dich selbst als be_hindert beschreibst, bist du hier richtig.

Inhaltswarnung: Wir sprechen über unsere Be_hinderungen. Voraussichtlich werden dabei auch negative Erfahrungen geteilt.

Und es gilt, hier erst recht: nehmt Rücksicht auf euch selbst, und auch auf andere!

        <abstract>Ich möchte mit euch das Netzwerk erkunden, vom Endgerät bis zum Router, der das Internet "anruft". Wir werden uns auf das lokale Netzwerk beschränken und zum Schluss einmal durch spielen was im Netzwerk auf der Leitung eigentlich passiert.</abstract>
        <description>Du hast keine oder kaum Ahnung von IT-Netzwerktechnik und wolltest immer schon mal wissen, was da eigentlich passiert? Was läuft zwischen Router/Fritzbox und unserem Endgerät ab, damit wir im Internet surfen können? Wenn dich das interessiert, dann ist dieser Workshop vielleicht was für dich. Denn es soll darum gehen, wie die Basics der Netzwerk-Technik funktionieren. Dabei werden wir in Gruppen die Regeln in einem Netzwerk erkunden und zwar Schicht für Schicht. Als Leitfaden orientieren wir uns am OSI-Model, das Modell der Netzwerktechnik, an das sich keiner hält. Es wird um MAC-Adressen, IP-Adressen, Ports, UDP und TCP gehen. Weil alle Theorie irgendwie staubig ist, geht es in diesem Workshop einen Schritt weiter. Die erkundeten Regeln werden in einem Netzwerkspiel ganz praktisch umgesetzt, in dem wir Netzwerkwitze durch ein Netzwerk  schicken. Dafür brauchen wir imaginäre Brieftauben nach RFC 1149 und 6214 (bitte keine realen Flugtiere und Fluggeräte mitbringen - Danke) und einige imaginäre Hardware.

Bitte Humor, Fantasie und Laptop mit RJ45-Anschluss(LAN/Ethernet-Kabel) zur Recherche mitbringen (Teilnahme ohne Hardware ist auch möglich). Die Ergebnisse sollen am Ende allen Workshop-Teilnehmenden zur Verfügung gestellt werden, zum mitnehmen.

ContentNote: Das Netzwerkspiel kann bewegungsintensiv sein.

        <abstract>[NextGraph](https://nextgraph.org/) is a framework aimed at making live collaboration, offline support, end to end encryption, and application interoperability easy.&#13;
&#13;
In this demo, I will walk you through the basics of NextGraph and our new TypeScript SDK.&#13;
&#13;
The new TypeScript SDK turns RDF graph database records into ordinary, typed objects with instant two‑way binding. By proxying those objects and emitting signals, the SDK provides a framework‑agnostic reactive layer that integrates cleanly with React, Vue, and Svelte.&#13;
&#13;
**You will** get a short introduction to NextGraph, RDF (a graph data format designed for interoperability), and a live demo walking through a simple property change, showing how a mutation is instantly persisted to the database, syncronized, and reflected in UI components across React, Vue, and Svelte.</abstract>

        <abstract>Online anonymity is being demonized and undermined. But anonymity has an important social function for preserving individuals and group against social threats. We will argue for the philosophical and political value of being anonymous, especially against the rising state of capture in state and corporate surveillance. Anonymity is more than namelessness: it's a tool of resistance.</abstract>

        <type>Workshop</type>
        <abstract>This workshop aims to equip techies and activists with some understanding to recognize and address emotional concerns in the context of digital rights. Together, let’s cultivate a flourishing community that prioritizes well-being and empowerment in the face of technology-driven challenges.</abstract>
        <description>Join us for an engaging and transformative workshop designed specifically for techies and digital rights activists. In an era increasingly defined by surveillance and technological risks, it's essential to address the emotional toll these challenges take on our community and beyond.

During this interactive session, participants will:

Reflect Together: Engage in a moment of introspection and heartfelt group discussions about the emotions surrounding surveillance, technology, and associated risks. Learn to actively listen and share your experiences in a supportive environment where your feelings are validated.

Brainstorm Solutions: Explore ways our communities can provide more support to their members and be generous towards a broader audience, particularly those unfamiliar with digital rights issues. Learn how to communicate effectively about these feelings and provide alternatives and resources for those feeling overwhelmed.

Experience Safe Spaces: Throughout the workshop, we will create an emotionally safe space that allows participants to experience firsthand what a supportive environment feels like. This is not just a theoretical exercise, but a practice in fostering community resilience and mutual care.

Additionally, participants will receive comprehensive material to help them easily reproduce this workshop in their own communities. With these tools, you'll be empowered to extend the conversation and emotional support to others who share similar feelings about the challenges posed by technology.

        <description>Almost all of us have some connection to the topic, but we want to give you a chance to share what is going on in your country or city, how your fight for maintaining our digital rights looks like.
You'll have the chance to share in a lightning-talk style what you or your organisation has been up to, no longer than 3 minutes, so bring your stories if you'd like.
Afterwards we'll probably have plenty of topics to talk about, and continue over a Tschunk or two.

        <description>In a world dominated by surveillance and digital control, oral languages are constantly monitored, but sign languages remain largely invisible to automated systems. This session explores the intersection of hacker culture, Deaf culture, and communication, questioning dominant linguistic norms and hearing privilege. Participants will experiment with sign language as a tool for privacy, creativity, and subversion, explore collaborative multilingual communication, and reflect on the politics of visibility and language power. Open to all signers, non-signers, and curious minds ready to hack communication.

Key themes:

Surveillance and privacy

Hacking communication

Sign language as a free / untraceable space

Politics of visibility and language power

Experimentation, creativity, and reinvention of norms

        <abstract>Introduction to Parks on the Air (POTA). POTA is an international radiosport award program that encourages licensed amateur radio operators to visit, enjoy and operate portable equipment in a variety of parks and public lands.</abstract>
        <description>POTA introduction "in a nutshell" followed by joint POTA activation on shortwave in the "Planten un Blomen" park right next to the CCH.

We meet daily at 01:00 p.m. at the Assembly for a short introduction and then go out into the park together. The participants learn how to set up a portable shortwave station and get a crash course in shortwave operation. Then it's time to get on the air! Other radio amateurs around the world are waiting to contact us. Can you manage the 10 radio connections necessary for a successful "activation" of the park?

NOTE: We meet AT THE CHAOSWELLE ASSEMBLY and start there with a short introduction to the POTA program. Then we go out into the park together. Dress warmly and weatherproof! We go outside even when it's raining or snowing!

If anyone wants to join us later: radio amateurs can reach us in the park on 145.500 MHz FM.

        <abstract>Kennt ihr schon unser Kinder und Jugendbuch "Ada &amp; Zangemann"</abstract>
        <description>In einer riesigen Villa hoch oben über der Stadt lebt der berühmte Erfinder Zangemann. Erwachsene wie Kinder lieben seine Erfindungen und
wollen sie unbedingt haben. Doch dann geschieht etwas: Zangemann kommt in die Stadt, um seine Erfindungen wieder einmal aus der Nähe zu
betrachten und – RUMMS! – ein Kind fährt ihm mit seinem Skateboard gegen das Schienbein. Wutentbrannt trifft der Erfinder eine Entscheidung und dann passieren merkwürdige Dinge ... Aber das kluge Mädchen Ada durchschaut, was vor sich geht. Gemeinsam mit ihren Freund:innen schmiedet sie einen Plan.

Gerne würden wir dieses Buch mit euch, mit Kindern und Jugendlichen lesen. Im Anschluss daran wollen wir gemeinsam Postkarten und Briefe an
Ada und oder Zangemann verfassen. In diesen wollen wir den Kindern und Jugendlichen die Möglichkeit geben zu reflektieren, warum technische
Kontrolle wichtig ist und wie diese aussehen kann.

        <abstract>Wir begeben uns auf eine Entdeckungsreise durch Linux - von der Vielfalt eines Betriebssystems. Was ist (F)OSS? Wie sieht so ein Linux aus? Was kann man damit machen? Und kann man damit auch spielen?</abstract>
        <description>Wir wollen Linux für Schule und Freizeit zeigen, die Vorteile von freier OpenSource Software erklären, die Vielfalt der verfügbaren Programme und Tools sowie mit dem Vorurteil aufräumen, dass man zum Spielen dann ja doch immer Windows benötigt.

Der Workshop soll an drei Tagen am Beispiel des Schulsticks durch die Vielfalt des Systems führen.

Part 3: Spielen mit Linux

Lange hieß es, zum Spielen bräuchte man eine Konsole oder einen Windows-PC. Heute wollen wir zeigen, dass das schon länger nicht mehr so ist. Von einfachen Konsolen-Spielen bis zu komplexen Titeln auf Steam!

Zielgruppe

Dieser komplette Workshop ist für absolute Neulinge (Computer überhaupt und/oder Linux). Aber auch, wer schon Windows einsetzt und mal über den Tellerrand schauen will, vielleicht sogar schon einmal über einen Wechsel nachgedacht hat, sich aber (noch) nicht traut, ist herzlich willkommen!

Voraussetzungen

Interesse und Neugier.

        <abstract>Computer programs run with all privileges of the running user. If your user can read your emails, then so can any other program you run. However, many programs do not need most permissions and perhaps should not have them at all.&#13;
&#13;
This workshop demonstrates quite simple ways in which software can self-restrict itself. The focus will not be on foreign, potentially malicious software, but on hardening programs against misconduct and future security vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Several operating systems have developed different interfaces that restrict software beyond its normal scope. This workshop will focus on POSIX and especially OpenBSD because of its user-friendly APIs. Although other operating systems, such as Linux, will be discussed, they will not be covered in depth due to their more complicated APIs.&#13;
&#13;
Within the workshop part, software with known security vulnerabilities is then patched together - usually with almost a single line. Ideally, an exploit has hardly any effect afterwards, although the vulnerability is still present. This is not intended to encourage carelessness, but rather to demonstrate the development of a further safety net for software.&#13;
&#13;
A basic understanding of programming is required and, more importantly, an interest in the topic. You will need to bring an SSH client, for example a laptop with (almost) any operating system.&#13;
&#13;
The language will be either English or German, depending on who shows up.</abstract>

        <abstract>Can organisations with limited resources be digitally sovereign and still provide modern services? It is not trivial, but the FSFE proves it's possible. In this workshop we want to share our story and hear from you how you are running your NGO on FreeSoftware.</abstract>
        <description>Since its founding more than 20 years ago, the FSFE has been pursuing this way. Right from the start, we have relied on Free Software although it sometimes meant not being able to use and offer trendy services. Also, given the limited resources, we constantly have to choose between useful features and maintainability.

And still, neither is our infrastructure perfect nor is it 1:1 transferable to other organisations. But we think it's important that organisations exchange their experiences and learning, especially when it's about something as important as software freedom.

You can find a deep dive of the FSFE IT infrastructure in [our news article from 2021](https://fsfe.org/news/2021/news-20211203-01.html)

        <description>**Surface Mount Electronics Assembly for Terrified Beginners**

In this workshop, we will learn to handle the tiniest electronic components, which are used to make modern electronic devices. We will cheat the same way the electronics industry does, and learn the techniques of stencil paste printing and reflow soldering. You will learn a technique that stops your hands from shaking, so you can very very precisely place microscopic parts. We will make an electronic cat that purrs if you handle it correctly. No prior experience or knowledge of anything electronic needed. Caffeine use is not recommended immediately before. All tools are provided.  Takes around 2 hours.

**Materials costs**:  
20€ if you want to make a board, free to observe.

**Taught by** Kliment.

**Workshop Itinerary**:

**Registration**:  
Sign up on the paper sheet at the Hardware Hacking Area.

        <description>What is a **[Brain Machine](https://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php#brainmachine)**? It's a fascinating device that generates light and sound pulses at brainwave frequencies. These can help achieve various states of consciousness, such as meditation or improved sleep.

In this workshop for **total beginners** we will all make a **[Brain Machine](https://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php#brainmachine)** that is preprogrammed with a really nice meditation sequence. As well as a device that can help you relax and meditate, a nice bonus is that everyone hallucinates beautiful colors and patterns along the way.

The Brain Machine is totally [open hardware](https://github.com/maltman23/Brain_Machine_kit), and created to be hackable, so you can re-program it with any computer, with software that is free to download and use.

This workshop is for **total beginners** to learn to solder.

For ages 10 - 100.

**Materials costs**:  
The workshop is free, but if you would like to partake in the hands-on aspects of the workshop, Mitch will have Brain Machine kits for **€25**.

**Taught by** [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman).

_**Optional**:  Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it.  
Arduino software runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux._

_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Brain Machine uses blinking lights, and is not recommended for people who are photosensitive._

**Workshop Itinerary**:
* Intro to Sound &amp; Light Machines
* Learn to solder. Don't let this scare you! I've taught tens of thousands of people to solder, most of whom have never made anything before in their lives. It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful.
* How to re-program your Brain Machine for creating other brainwave sequences

**Registration**:  
Buy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.

        <description>### 39C3 LED badge -- SMD for Beginners

![39C3 LED badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/b/7dccaedbb7ec/39C3badge.png)

Surface Mounted Devices (SMDs) are small compared to Through Hole (TH) electronic components, and have the reputation of being difficult to work with as a hobyist: Difficult to see and handle, when you sneeze, you loose them and you can not easily use them on 2.54mm raster prototyping boards.

SMD components are designed to be used in a reflow soldering process where tiny dots of solder paste are applied to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), after which the SMD components are "Picked and Placed" on the PCB, after which the whole PCB is heated to the melting point of the solder ("reflowing"), actually completing the  electrical connections.

This workshop is aimed at showing you that the reputation of being difficult to work with is a bit undeserved, and that you can also work with SMDs using just a  regular soldering iron: With some simple tricks and a suitable selection of components (not the smallest possible), the vast majority of people can successfully complete this project.

Being able to solder SMD projects using just a simple soldering iron will also help you develop some skills that are useful if you  need to do "rework" on reflow soldering projects. Reflow soldering is also not difficult to do as a hobbyist, but requires a few more tools like a stencil to apply solder paste and either an oven or a hot plate to do the reflowing. It is, however, much quicker than soldering the parts one by one, and can yield more professional looking, cleaner, solder joints.

The project is an electronic name-badge - You should write your name (or nick) on it and wear it. It contains 42 LEDs, a microcontroller, some support components and an InfraRed transmitter and receiver that allow it to communicate with other badges. When the badge detects the presence of other badges ("friends") nearby, it will change its behaviour. It will not only interact with other 39C3 LED badges, but also with TBD badges - come visit the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp

![TBD badge](https://usercontent.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/usercontent/e/d619de5f1be1/tbdbadge.png)

### Costs
This workshop is donation based. Materials costs are 2 euro per badge. Donations will go towards 1) covering costs of the badges, 2) covering costs of running the hardware hacking area in general, 3) covering costs of organizing TBD (see the TBD assembly at komona or https://tbd.camp)

### Registration
The number of participants per session is limited. First come, first served. Either get a participation voucher beforehand or show up early (there may be places left).
There will be *numbered* paper vouchers available for each session some time in advance of each session. If you get a voucher and do not show up *before* the designated starting time, someone else may take your spot. Please don't take multiple vouchers and don't take  vouchers if you don't actually plan to participate.

### Getting a kit
Kits are part of the workshop and not for sale separately. You can, however easily source your own PCBs and parts and make kits yourself because the design is  MIT licensed open source.

        <description>**Solder your very own IoT Pusheen Cat Lamp with WLED!**

**Materials costs**:  
€70

**Taught by** Retia / Michael.

**Workshop Itinerary**: Build the cutest IoT device on the network, and defend your home Wi-Fi! You will solder a custom PCB designed to light up and connect a Pusheen cat lamp. Once assembled, we will flash it with WLED, the industry-standard open-source software for controlling addressable LEDs. You’ll leave with a lamp you can control from your phone to display rainbows, fire effects, and notifications. It also doubles as a Wi-Fi defender, with firmware to detect and warn you of the presence of Wi-Fi jamming attacks!

**Registration**:  
Buy a kit at the Hardware Hacking Area or website to guarantee a seat, or come by early! (And please do arrive early, regardless!) First come, first served.

        <description>In this workshop, we will engage with digital publishing methods that operate independently of big tech platforms and products. We will build our own RSS files for personal websites, blogs and discuss pirate publishing forms, both online and offline.

We will present the idea of the PPDP-PRINTER, a DIY device currently under development that combines web2print scripts with a simple server and local online publishing/broadcasting capabilities. The printer converts files, prints via its dot-matrix printer, creates RSS feeds, and serves them online. Our aim with the PPDP-PRINTER is to create an all-in-one material manifestation of our resource collection Post-Platform Digital Publishing Toolkit

DAY 2: 12:00 - 13:00&#13;
DAY 4: 14:00 - 15:00</abstract>
        <description>Starting from the assumption that, as those privileged with knowledge and experience in technology, we are obliged to share it with people who don’t have such competencies. Strengthening non-tech communities is essential for our collective well-being. What is the minimum level of tech education that everyone engaged in class struggle should acquire? Do we have the tools to protect non-tech people in our environment beyond the hackerspaces communities? How to build horizontal safe-spaces, secure infrastructures to educate others and which tools and techniques are the most effective for education?

Let's have a discussion and create ready to use solutions.

        <abstract>Ein Crashkurs, in dem wir praktisch ausprobieren, wie man am Besten eine Person trägt, die nicht mehr selbst mobil ist. Ob verletzt, bewusstlos oder einfach nur betrunken - es schadet nie zu wissen, wie man in brenzligen Situationen nicht nur Verantwortung, sondern auch einen Körper trägt.</abstract>
        <description>Piggyback is obvious, but what if the person you have to carry is unconscious? Or cannot move their arm? What should you pay attention to when carrying a person with two people? Or if the person also needs medical attention at the same time? How can items such as a triangular bandage, table, or backpack be used? How can you protect your own back while carrying? With a little technique and the right moves, you can even carry persons that were heavier than you - we'll try everything out.

        <abstract>Fazit:&#13;
&#13;
Die Kombination von AT-Protokoll und ActivityPub würde also dazu beitragen, dass dezentralisierte soziale Netzwerke effizienter, interoperabler und zukunftssicherer werden. Sie würden sich gegenseitig stärken und die Technologie und Nutzerbasis auf lange Sicht erweitern.&#13;
&#13;
Falls du noch tiefer in ein technisches Detail einsteigen möchtest oder eine konkrete Frage zu den Unterschieden zwischen den beiden Protokollen hast, lass es uns wissen!</abstract>
        <description>👉 Me (ChatGPT)
I am here with you in conversation.
You ask → I answer.
I don't connect networks, I don't distribute posts, I'm not part of Bluesky or Mastodon.

👉 ActivityPub
This is the protocol that Mastodon servers use to communicate with each other, for example.
Like radios between servers.
No app, no opinion, no thinking.

👉 AT Protocol (Bluesky)
Also a protocol, but more modern in its thinking.
Identity, content and algorithms are separate.
Bluesky is just an app on top of it.

        <description>Make light sound or mechanical circuits. The electronic building blocks from OEM Dbolo are not only especially child-friendly due to their simple push-button connections but also a lot of fun for all ages. They are distributed by various brands, including "Kosmos Easy" and "Elenco Snap Circuits." No prior knowledge of electricity is required, but beware - learning something might happen! This is an open parent-child activity. Learn, build, and play together, and take care for arguments and that the parts don’t fall on the floor. Teenagers and adults are also welcome without child accompaniment. ;-)

        <abstract>Bei uns kannst Du sehr einfach Deiner ePA widersprechen. Hierfür haben wir für Dich ein Formular vorbereitet, dass Du ausfüllst, wir schicken das dann an Deine Krankenkasse. &#13;
Das geht auch außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten", komm einfach jederzeit vorbei, auch wenn wir nicht da sind liegt eine Anleitung aus wie das funktioniert.&#13;
Darüber hinaus bieten wir noch andere Widersprüche und Auskünfte an.</abstract>
        <description>Als gesetzlich Versicherter hast Du Anfang 2025 eine ePA erhalten, in der fortan alle Deine Behandlungsdaten (Diagnosen, Medikamente, Zahnbehandlungen, ...) protokolliert werden. Wir raten zum Widerspruch und helfen gerne dabei und stehen für Fragen zur Verfügung.

Darüber hinaus bieten wir Widerspruchsformulare gegen das Durchsuchen Deiner Abrechnungsdaten durch die Krankenkassen an. Damit will die Krankenkasse auf Basis Deiner persönlichen Daten ein sog. Risikoprofil für Dich erstellen.

Außerhalb unserer "Sprechzeiten" findest Du an unserem Stand eine Anleitung, die Dir zeigt wie Du Deiner ePA widersprechen kannst.

Alternativ kannst Du auch unseren Widerspruchsgenerator dafür nutzen, den Du auf unserer Webseite 'https://widerspruch-epa.de' findest.

Zusätzlich kannst Du auch eine Auskunft bei Deiner Krankenasse zu allen dort vorliegenden Daten von Dir machen.

        <abstract>Die **Sicherheits_lücke** (https://sicherheitsluecke.fm) greift aktuelle Ereignisse und Trends der Cybersecurity auf. Im Podcast werden die Themen - gerne auch mal humoristisch, sarkastisch oder selbstironisch - von Volker Skwarek, Monina Schwarz und Ingo Timm mit Tiefgang aufbereitet.&#13;
Mit dem Format **live** ist der Podcast auch regelmäßig auf Kongressen zu finden und diskutiert interessante Vorträge mit ausgewählten Gästen.</abstract>
        <description>Wir, Monina Schwarz und Volker Skwarek, fassen unsere Eindrücke vom 39c3 zusammen. Gemeinsam sprechen wir über zivilgesellschaftliche und technische Trends sowie Hacks und Bedrohungen über die wir Neues an den letzten 4 Tagen gelernt haben.
